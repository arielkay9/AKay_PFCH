There are many unsung heroes behind this award. Of the very nice things that were said I believe the thing that pleases me most is the assignment we got to do a documentary film for UNICEF. If through the medium of the motion picture we can make the world better understand the problem of the world's children, I think perhaps we'll be on our way to making the world understand itself a little better. I'm grateful and proud indeed to be a part of a tremendous industry that has it within its power to accomplish this, and I'm grateful indeed to be one of its servants. Thank you very much.

Then you have to have a great director. And then you have to be nominated and voted. So I would like to thank the memory of that wonderful little girl, Miss Anne Frank, who wrote with such depth and perception about human beings.

1960,Honorary Award,None,To Stan Laurel for his creative pioneering in the field of cinema comedy. (not present; accepted by presenter)," DANNY KAYE:
Ladies and gentlemen, when the fat man with the derby hat and the tall, thin man with the sad face first came on the screen together, that was way back in 1926. They made the world laugh [for] 24 years. Twenty-four years. And they made us laugh because in them we kind of saw ourselves – ridiculous, frustrated, up to our necks in trouble, but nevertheless ourselves. Oliver Hardy delicately tipped his derby hat with his pudgy little fingers and left us a little while back. But the thin, sad-faced one, the one from whose fertile mind sprang many of the universally humorous notions that have been borrowed so freely by the comedians who have followed, he's still with us. Unhappily, he isn't well enough to be here with us this evening, but I'm very proud indeed to accept for him from the Board of Governors this award for ""creative pioneering in the field of comedy,"" presented to one of the really great men of our chosen profession, Mr. Stan Laurel.

1970,Honorary Award,None,To Orson Welles for superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures. (accepted on film)," ORSON WELLES:
Ladies and gentlemen, with this great honor may I say that it's a lot more fun to look forward. Looking backward over some thirty years in the movies is something that I like to do as seldom as possible, but I can't forget that I didn't spend those years alone. Every filmmaker knows how much was done for him and by how many. If I could call just half of all those who deserve it to stand beside me now in front of this camera, just to get 'em in one shot we'd need Cinerama. It'd be quite a crowd scene.

As for the public, I hope that they will understand why this is the more precious just because it does not come to me from them, much less from the critics, but from movie people themselves, the ones who love movies most. We need the public; the public doesn't need us. That's the truth of it. We don't really fill a pressing popular need; we try to create it. And if we didn't love movies as much as we do, if we weren't a little crazy on the subject, there wouldn't be any movies at all. I treasure this award as an expression of this happy lunacy, and may I accept it, please, not so much for what I may have done as for what I hope to do. God willing I'm going to make some movies that deserve it. Meanwhile, this encouragement is very welcome. With all my heart, I thank you for it.

This is my first visit to Los Angeles and I have enjoyed every moment of it. I met a lot of warm, generous people and I am very happy that Ingmar Bergman asked me to represent him on this big occasion, though I would have been more happy if he himself could have been here tonight getting personally all the respect and love which has been shown him. He has asked me to say to you that he is sitting on his little island in the Baltic writing on a new script. He isn't here because he feels that a long trip at this moment would do great harm to his concentration on work and he believes that he shows his respect and gratefulness to the honor bestowed to him by the Board and members of the Academy by staying home finishing his script. And he also feels that this fantastic award will inspire him in his fulfillment of his work. Ingmar Bergman says, ""I am deeply touched and very, very grateful.""

I can't thank anybody.  I feel that we all have, are part of each other. That we've all contributed.  And we work together and we're all the same people. And I love you all for all the experiences I've had.  Except that I want to say to Cornelia Williams Hurlbut, my first piano teacher, and Rose Lorenz, my dancing teacher in Des Moines, and my father Buck Leachman who paid the bills – wait – and finally my mother, whose imagination and funny sense of humor and almost Walter Mitty life herself led to all of this.

Frank, you shouldn't go away; it seems like we've stood this way before.  But thank you dear, dear, wonderful friend.

And of course I am profoundly grateful to the governors of the Academy.  I was listening to his words back there, Frank, and I thought for a minute, someone out there'll think I was kind of special – far from it.  You know the people of this nation have a golden tradition of taking care of each other. And across America right now there are men and women, countless numbers of them, young and old, who are giving of themselves to hospitals, to orphanages, to drug clinics, to youth, and even possibly watching a little child take her first steps after being crippled as I have watched.  So the only unique thing about me tonight is that I am here with this, knowing that it belongs to so many others.  I would also like to tell you that I have been the victim of this kindness, and I want to thank each and every one of them and all the letters that were sent to me over the years for all they did for me while I was not quite well.

1974,Actress in a Supporting Role,Murder on the Orient Express,Ingrid Bergman," INGRID BERGMAN:
Thank you very much indeed.  It's always very nice to get an Oscar.  But in the past he has shown that he is very forgetful and also has the wrong timing. Because last year when ""Day and Night"" won for the best picture I couldn't believe it that Valentina Cortese was not nominated, because she gave the most beautiful performance.  [Finds Cortese in the audience:]  There you are!  She gave the most beautiful performance that all we actresses recognized because, after all, we have all forgotten our lines and always open the wrong doors, and it was wonderful to see her do it so beautifully.  Therefore I am... It's so ironic that this year she's nominated when the picture won last year.  I don't quite understand that, but here I am and I'm her rival and I don't like it at all.  Please forgive me, Valentina.  I didn't mean to.  Thank you.

But I would like to thank the artistic community for sustaining me in my wins and losses and sitting on the curb, whatever it was.  I don't think there's an award for what Warren Beatty had to do to get ""Shampoo"" on, but I respect him and love him, and Robert Towne.  And my director Hal Ashby, who encourages an actor to fly without a net because you know that he's there to catch you.  Thank you.

Wow.  They have told me that the talent of a producer lies in the talents the producer selects to work with.  And I think I showed the producer's talent when I picked Robin Lehman to work with.

ROBIN LEHMAN:
I'm a fool if I open my mouth after that one.  Anyway, it's a little difficult to have an idea, you know, come up with an idea to make a film. It's even more difficult to make that film.  The worst problem of all is to find out what's wrong with the film.  And this lady helps me find out what's wrong with the film.  I owe her thanks.

Though I should have known that when I had someone like Paddy Chayefsky writing and saying things that we all feel but can't express, and when we have someone like Sidney Lumet who makes one want to act forever, and a producer like Howard Gottfried, then how can I miss?  But I know that my mother would be delighted.  She had great potential for an actress but didn't think she should do it, so she pushed me and was delighted.  And Michael Chekhov, the great actor and teacher who I studied with, who gave me a love and respect for the theater, which is the whole point of why we're all here.  It's a great profession and we have to keep thinking it all the time.  And we all do.  And we all love it.

And I salute you and I pay tribute to you and I think you should be very proud that in the last few weeks you've stood firm and you have refused to be intimidated by the threats of a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums whose behavior is an insult to the stature of Jews all over the world and to their great and heroic record of struggle against fascism and oppression.  And I salute that record, and I salute all of you for having stood firm and dealt a final blow against that period when Nixon and McCarthy launched a worldwide witch hunt against those who tried to express in their lives and their work the truth that they believed in.  I salute you, and I thank you, and I pledge to you that I will continue to fight against anti-Semitism and fascism.  Thank you.

I'm signing part of what I'm saying tonight because, while we were making the movie, we all became more aware of the problems of the handicapped. Over 14 million people are deaf.  They are the invisible handicapped and can't share this evening, so this is my way of acknowledging them.  [End sign language.]

I'm so proud and grateful.  It's been almost eight years.  This film, ""Coming Home,"" was born in Santa Monica where we live, in the cramped offices of the Indochina Peace Campaign, as a lot of us whose lives have been bound up with the war sat on the floor.  And some of them were veterans.  I thank, I thank all of them.  One of them was my husband, Tom Hayden; one of them was Bruce Gilbert, who has become my partner and is the associate producer of ""Coming Home.""

I want to thank Waldo Salt, the first – how do you...?  Heavy.  The first industry heavy who stuck his neck out and believed in the project.  In fact he believed so much in it that he worked for two years for nothing.  And he lead us to Jerry Hellman, our producer, who fought for us.  And I want to thank you, Jerry, very much.  And I want to thank Haskell Wexler who photographed it so sensitively and Bob Jones who came through in the pinch.  And I want to thank Hal Ashby; you're not here, Hal, but I want to thank you for your taste and for your courage, for your ability with the scissors.  And I want to thank Penny Milford and Bobby Carradine and Bruce Dern and my pal Jon Voight, and Mike Medavoy and Eric Pleskow and Arthur Krim and Marcia Nasatir for getting us the money to make it.

They told me of the painful experiences they had suffered in the name of patriotism. Tonight, six years later, I have an Oscar, but for the people of whom I wrote the war still goes on.  I'm thinking of them tonight.  Thank you.

I would like to thank particularly and only, not because of anything except that I think they are the people who made the picture, some of the people that we talked to, some of the people who shared their lives, their war, their post-war, their pain, their difficulties with us that made the heart of the screenplay.  Bobby Muller and his fine wife, Bill Hager, T. Hager, Ron Kovic, Roger Steffens and his Mary, Tim Page, and so many others that I can't list; I hope that they will forgive me.  Some of the people, who would prefer not to be named I believe, who worked in the veterans facilities here in the Bronx and who shared their experiences with us.  To all of the men who fought in Vietnam: those who lost their lives, those who lost their innocence, and those who, working with defoliants, still don't know whether they've lost their lives.

""Norma Rae"" was a real gift to me.  It was given to me by Laddie and Jay and Gareth of the old Fox.  It was given to me by Alex Rose and Tamara Asseyev, who fought very hard to get it made.  It was given to me by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr.  And it truly was a gift, every single word.  It was given to me by John Alonzo, who followed me around with a camera and never hoped to shine himself, just gave it all to me.  It was given to me by the actors, especially Beau Bridges and Ron Leibman, whose real craft and talent and love and support is why I'm here.

And mostly it was given to me because of Marty Ritt.  Marty Ritt is ""Norma Rae.""  He has fought all his life to put on films that are courageous, that say things, that are part of him that he feels should be said, that have the box-office potential of seventy-five cents, sometimes less.  And I thank him for that.  He's taught me a lot.  And the best gift that Marty gave me was that he let me feel all the time that I was doing it myself, and I know that I didn't.

And on a personal note, I'd like to thank my mother and my sister for holding me together and just plain old holding me.  And my kids, Peter and Eli, for being my constant inspiration, and no matter how many awards I win, if it weren't them I wouldn't be worth a damn.  Thank you very much.

I don't think there's any difference really between what you feel you have to do in your heart and success.  They're inseparable.

Jim Brooks deeply wanted to make a film about the defects and imperfections and foibles of people in a humorous and loving way.  And he had such passion. It was unbelievable to watch.  He's being very modest with himself tonight. It was unbelievable.  His sense of truth was so accurate that he overwhelmed his own insecurities, and Paramount's.  I guess we all did the same thing.

I have wanted to work with the comic chemistry of Jack Nicholson since his chicken salad sandwich scene in ""Easy Pieces.""  And to have him in bed was such middle-aged joy.  I wanted to work with the turbulent brilliance of Debra Winger.  She literally inhabited the character so thoroughly that I thought for four months I had two daughters.

But in the end just let me say one thing.  Films and life are like clay waiting for us to mold it.  And when you trust your own insides, and that becomes achievement, it's a kind of a principle that seems to me is at work with everyone.  God bless that principle.  God bless that potential that we all have for making anything possible if we think we deserve it.  I deserve this.  Thank you.

1983,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Year of Living Dangerously,Linda Hunt," LINDA HUNT:
This is extraordinary.  There was an Indonesian phrase in the film which translates into English as ""water from the moon.""  And it means that which is unattainable, the impossible, that which one can never have or know.  Making ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" for me was ""water from the moon.""

I want to thank the members of the Academy so much for honoring me with this recognition and this encouragement at the beginning of my work in film, when I still have so much to learn about such a complex and a powerful medium.  And I want to dedicate this to my parents and to Peter Weir, with much love.  And to everyone I love who is out there watching tonight, here is the sign [kisses her thumb then holds it up].

It's so wonderful to be receiving these, this most precious honor, from Jennifer Beals whose performance in the film made it that much more special for all of us.  I hope I can read this.

I'd like to thank the members of the Academy, my terrifically talented co-lyricist Keith Forsey for making writing so imaginative and [...unintelligible...] so much fun.  For me personally there are so many people to thank.  Just to be nominated with the likes of Alan and Marilyn Bergman and Michel Legrand is an honor enough.  But let me begin with my parents, who are here tonight.  If it weren't for them I would not be here tonight.  I'd like to thank them.  My manager and dearest friend, Selma Rubin, whose love and guidance, and her family, for fourteen years of supporting me, has helped so much.

Thank you.  I went to New York to study acting the summer that I was twenty-one.  And like thousands of actors before me and thousands of actors after me, I went through the usual scores of moonlighting jobs, the usual scores of rejection, and the usual legions of prophets of doom who are always there and always at the ready to give you the up-to-minute odds against your ever making anything of yourself in this business.  And at this moment, all of those sort of doleful memories have suddenly transformed themselves into nothing more than the sort of charming and amusing anecdotes for my memoirs! I cannot, cannot thank you enough.

There are a few people I'd like to thank with all my heart, very quickly. The great Terry Gilliam.  Richard LaGravenese, our screenwriter.  An extraordinary cast; it was an honor to work with them.  Roger Pratt, our cinematographer. Steve Randall, Lynda Obst, Debra Hill, Howard Feuer, Marsha McManus.  My family and my close friends, for their patience and their respect and their support.  And finally I would like to thank Albert Innaurato and the late Joseph Papp who gave me my first shot on the New York stage and my first break in the big time.  And especially the late, great Joe Papp, who once in a rehearsal for that play nudged me out of the shadow and into the light and told me to stay there in no uncertain terms.  I have.  I do.

Because it's overwhelming to see so many faces who've entertained and influenced me and thrilled me all my life, and it just takes my breath away.

Actually, I think I might have to give back the money.  And to Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, for her flawless adaptation.  To a superlative cast and crew.  To Sony Pictures Classics, for their dedication and commitment.  And especially to Sir Anthony Hopkins, for being, like this, the (k)night of my life.

Thank you.

BARBARA TRENT:
As well as the other two producers without whose perseverance the film would never have been completed, Nico Panigutti and Joanne Doroshow.  We'd like to take a moment and dedicate this film to all the people who have worked so hard for justice and truth and peace around the world.  And particularly the four people who have died who were working in association with this film, and the hundreds and possibly thousands of Panamanians who died in this invasion, whose stories might never otherwise be told because of the deceptive practices and tactics of our government with the complicity—I don't like it either, but it's the way it is—with the complicity of the major media.

We would like to also dedicate the film to the courageous Panamanian journalists and human rights activists who have defied the Panamanian ban against the screening of this film, at personal risk, to show it in the last few weeks in Panama, which, by the way, reversed the censorship ban which was nationwide.  And to the millions of Americans who may or may not get to see this film now that public TV has also refused a broadcast.

In closing, I'd just like to say we have a tremendous amount of potential in the world and those of us here have a tremendous amount of potential to impact the world.  Let's use it.  Let's challenge this new administration to reverse the legacy that we have left through our policies in the world and become the Americans that we're capable of.  Thank you very, very much.

Tonight I am asking for your help.  I call upon you to draw from the depths of your being to prove that we are a human race.  To prove that our love outweighs our need to hate.  That our compassion is more compelling than our need to blame.  That our sensitivity to those in need is stronger than our greed.  That our ability to reason overcomes our fear.  And that at the end of each of our lives, we can look back and be proud that we have treated others with the kindness, dignity and respect that every human being deserves.  Thank you and God bless.

I'm so overwhelmed.  To be with that group of actresses just slays me.  When I was six years old I started pretending to play the piano on the window sills of my bedroom in the house where I grew up.  And then after a while my parents realized that I wasn't going to stop, so they got me a cardboard keyboard to play to see if that might, you know, if I would get tired of that.  But I wasn't.  I didn't.  And so then they got me a piano.  So for the next ten years they let me have piano lessons.  So I need to thank Eileen Parish, my first piano teacher, and I need to thank my parents for letting me have these lessons.

And Jane Campion, I love you, I love you.  Thank you so much for giving me a character and an experience that was so difficult to say good-bye to, except that I don't have to say good-bye to it because it's everybody's now.

Well, when I was a student, which doesn't feel like so very long ago, I used to feel deeply cynical about awards nights like this, but tonight I'm really overwhelmed.  In fact I've been close to tears a few times.  And I'm just very pleased to be here and very proud to win this award.  And I'd like to say a very big thank you to my actors: Holly; Anna; Harvey and Sam who aren't here but were such gorgeous, tender, and vulnerable men in ""The Piano.""  I'd like to say, Michael Nyman, your music was just so extraordinary.  To me it was the heart of the film.  Jan, thank you for being my friend and producer.  A great big kiss to you, Colin, my husband.  And a special thank you to the Miramax brothers, Harvey and Bob, for bringing this film to America.  Thank you very much.

I want to thank the Academy so much.  This is such a wonderful honor, especially for a little film that seemed to have no future.  And it's just such a great honor.  I want to thank Orion Films, past and present, especially Marc Platt for letting us do this very peculiar little film in the first place.  And my dear friend Lynn Arost, the producer, who really stuck by the film even when it was sitting on a shelf in a bank vault in New York City.  To the writers of course, who created a marvelous character.  To the players, a wonderful group of actors that I was fortunate to work with, especially Mr. Tommy Lee Jones who really made the performance that I gave possible.  This is really a tribute to Tony Richardson.  He loved actors.  He loved everything about it.  He loved the acting, and he was the perfect person for me to work with.  He just kept nudging me over the edge, and with a character like this it's exactly what I needed.  And last of all, to my three children, who make all of this possible with their love and patience.  So thank you very, very much.

I'm so privileged to be in the company of these gifted women, including Jennifer Tilly, my colleague, who's so wonderful.  I'm in debt to my loyal friend and remarkable artist, Woody Allen.  He gave me such a gift with this role.  And with this gift came acting with John Cusack, being lit by the great cinematographer Carlo Di Palma, costumed by Jeffrey Kurland, working with Santo Loquasto, a great cast, a great crew.  My thanks also to Tracey Jacobs, Bobby Greenhut, Jean Doumanian, and Harvey and Bob Weinstein.

I'd like to thank the Academy for this wonderful honor, and its members and their hard work particularly in recognizing a film which is about the power of art to heal, and particularly the difference one young woman can make.  I'd like to particularly thank the subject of this film, Maya Lin, for her extraordinary gift to this country in designing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. It's an idea that would not have happened had it not been for the courage and sacrifice of Vietnam veterans.  And I'd like to thank the veterans for their service to this country and particularly two vets, Jan Scruggs and Robert Doubek, who had tenacity against great political opposition to build that beautiful memorial.

1994,Best Picture,Forrest Gump,"Wendy Finerman, Steve Tisch and Steve Starkey, Producers"," WENDY FINERMAN:
I'd like to say thank you to the Academy for this honor.  And it's just so wonderful to be acknowledged with a great group of movies.  Nine years ago I met a very special man who has since taken me on an amazing journey.  There were many people who gave him gifts along the way.  Eric Roth, you gave ""Forrest"" a soul.  Tom Hanks, you gave ""Forrest"" a heart.  And Bob Zemeckis, you gave ""Forrest"" a vision.  Steve Tisch and Steve Starkey, you were great co-parents.  ""Forrest"" was a labor of love to many people:  our wonderful cast and crew, Sherry, Jon, Michelle, John, Barry, Arthur, all the people at Paramount, Winston, Craig, Rand.  To my parents, grandparents, family, thank you for your support.  To my husband Mark Canton, for your love and always saying go make this dream a reality.  My parents always said dreams can come true, and to my own children, Dorothy, Henry and James, if you doubt it, please remember tonight because I always will.  Thank you.

STEVE TISCH:
All over the political map people have been calling ""Forrest"" their own.  But ""Forrest Gump"" isn't about politics or conservative values.  It's about humanity.  It's about respect, tolerance and unconditional love.  And tonight we should all feel proud that we are in a business where we entertain, we educate, and we empower.  I'd like to thank my family, my parents Joan and Bob, love to Jamie and to my two wonderful children, Hilary and Willy, and to my four best friends.  And finally, thanks to all the ""Forrest Gumps"" in the world.

STEVE STARKEY:
Well, I truly want to thank the Academy for making me the final person to thank them tonight.  Now I don't know if it was destiny or if it was chance that brought together the talented cast and extraordinary crew of ""Forrest Gump,"" but maybe as ""Forrest"" said: ""Maybe it was both, maybe both were happening at the same time.""  But in any case, as I look back I can't imagine making this film without any one of them or without the commitment of Sherry Lansing and Paramount Studios.  But most of all, the picture could not have been made without the gentle spirit of Tom Hanks and the guidance and inspiration of the guy we fondly call Bob Z, the truly visionary director Bob Zemeckis.  And I wish to thank them all, and especially my wife Olivia who has stood beside me over the years in everything I've done.  And hello to my parents.  Thank you all very much.

And I encourage writers and directors to keep these really interesting female roles coming, and while you're at it you can throw in a few for the men as well.

My family, friends and colleagues here tonight and all around the world, they know exactly who they are, you know who you are.  And I hope you already know how much your support and your care means to me, but I'm gonna name three.

Thank you very much. This is a great honor.  It's great to be here; it's wonderful.  It's been amazing being part of the success of ""The Full Monty"" over the past year.

I would like to thank the Academy from the bottom of my heart.  I would like to thank Emily Watson, and Fernanda Montenegro, and my friend Cate Blanchett, and the greatest one who ever was, Meryl Streep.  I don't feel very deserving of this in your presence.

But I would like to thank Harvey Weinstein and everybody at Miramax Films for their undying support of me.  I would like to -- I wouldn't be in this auditorium, let alone up here, if it wasn't for two incredibly talented men. Our director John Madden, thank you so much for all that you gave me.  You are so inspiring.  And to my soulful partner, Joseph Fiennes, who I share this with.  I wouldn't be here without him.  I would like to thank the rest of our miraculous cast and crew.  Our producers Donna Gigliotti and David Parfitt -- I didn't forget you this time!  Especially Jim Magill and Sophie Shand and my friend Ben Affleck.  I would like to thank my wonderful agent Rick Kurtzman who is a beautiful man and a wonderful agent and in his case that is not an oxymoron.  I would like to thank Harold Brown, Stuart Gelwarg*, and Stephen Huvane.

I would not have been able to play this role had I not understood love of a tremendous magnitude, and for that I thank my family.  My mother Blythe Danner, who I love more than anything, and my brother Jake Paltrow, who is just the dearest person in the whole world.  My earthly guardian angel, Mary Wigmore*.  And especially to my father Bruce Paltrow, who has surmounted insurmountable obstacles this year.  I love you more than anything in the world.  And to my grandpa Buster, who almost made it here tonight, but couldn't quite get here.  Grandpa, I want you to know that you have created a beautiful family who loves you and loves each other more than anything, and we thank you for that.

I would like to dedicate this to two young men who lost their lives very early.  Harrison Kravis and my cousin Keith Paltrow.  We miss you very much. And I thank you.  Thank you so much, everybody!

I feel for eight minutes on the screen I should only get a little bit of him. I do thank the Academy very much indeed.  I do think also that the best bit about the Academy Awards is being nominated.  You live in a kind of haze for several weeks, and the terrible thing is that somebody's got to win.  My heart goes out to all the other four who didn't.  And also, my admiration.

I do have to thank John Madden and Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, as I actually wrote to John Madden after ""Mrs. Brown"" and said, I will do anything in your next film.  If you want somebody to slouch in a doorway, you can count on me.  And I mean it, and I hope he bears me in mind next time.  I do thank you all very much indeed.  I am very moved by it.  Thank you.

I'm getting there, okay.  I don't know, we made this movie -- this is a movie about life and art.  And art and life combining is called magic.  For me, this was a great experience, a passion, for five years.  And nobody inspires me more than my brother Bob, who is my partner and best friend every day.  My loving wife Eve; my two rotten kids, Lily and Emma; my beautiful nieces, Sarah and Nicole; and my mom Miriam.  The Miriam of Miramax [music begins to play] who makes Jewish mothers look good.

Thank you, thank you so much.  We have come a long way.  To think that this movie wouldn't have been made three-and-a-half years ago, and we made it now for under two million dollars.   And now this.  It's quite remarkable.  I want to thank the Academy for their support and recognition of me and my work in a movie that is so important, and I am so proud to be a part of it.

This movie would have never been made -- I had, just on the off chance that I got up here, I brought this piece of paper because I knew I couldn't forget anyone, because everyone put their heart and soul into this movie and God knows no one got paid.  So first, Kimberly Peirce, for her fierce tenacity and vision.  Andy Bienen, our co-writer.  Killer Films, you guys always make important movies and I thank you for that.

I want to thank Michael Stremel, Lindsay Law and Bill Mechanic and everyone at Fox Searchlight for putting their wing around this small, little movie and giving us wings.  Larry Moss, my acting coach, who, without him, I could have never given this performance.  Thank you, Larry.  My mom, who's up there somewhere [in the balcony].  It looks like living out of our car was worth it. Holly Hein, for keeping my head on straight.  My publicist Troy Nankin, who is a beautiful, beautiful human being.  Kami Putnam, I have to thank you for fighting for me.  I'm almost done, I promise.  The Independent Film Channel, for helping us finish our movie.  And Hylda Queally and David Wirtschafter, for their support.

And last, but certainly not least, I want to thank Brandon Teena for being such an inspiration to us all.  His legacy lives on through our movie to remind us to always be ourselves, to follow our hearts, to not conform.  I pray for the day when we not only accept our differences, but we actually celebrate our diversity.  Thank you very much.

And since 9/11 there's been a lot of pain, in terms of families losing people, and now with the war, families losing people.  And God bless them. And I am standing here in front of my mother and my daughter and my whole life I've wanted to make my mother proud.  And now I want to make my daughter proud.  So thank you.

""Chicago"" began for me when I walked into a room of mirrors and watched Rob Marshall and three choreographers dance the entire show.  It was a powerful inspiration and continued to be as the collaboration expanded.  Sets, camera, stage lighting, an amazing cast who sang and danced, dancers, and my collaborators--Dale, Karen, Christine--all led by Bill Condon's script and Rob's clarity and heart.  Thanks to you all, and to Miramax and Marty Richards who let it all happen.   Thank you.

This is just unbelievable.  I'm so honored, touched and relieved that the Academy and the members of the Academy that have supported us have seen past the trolls and the wizards and the hobbits and are recognizing fantasy this year.  Fantasy is an F-word that hopefully the five second delay won't do anything with.  I just want to say a very few quick words especially to the people of New Zealand and the government of New Zealand and the city councils and everybody who supported us the length and breadth of the country--Billy Crystal is welcome to come and make a film in New Zealand any time he wants. A special thanks to Peter Nelson and Ken Kamins, who were with me right from the days of ""Bad Taste"" and ""Meet the Feebles,"" which were wisely overlooked by the Academy at that time.  And I especially want to pay tribute to our wonderful producer Barrie Osborne.  And I'd please like him to say a few words.

BARRIE M. OSBORNE:
It's a great honor to be here.  I started out in the business thirty-five years ago getting people coffee.  And I wonder if the fact that I dated Billy Crystal's cousin so many years ago has anything to do with this.  But it is really a great pleasure to be in such great company--uh-oh, I'm in trouble now--to be nominated with these four other great films, and after these many years to receive this award is really a thrill for all of us and we all thank the Academy.  It's really a tribute to the talents of all the people, both in front of the camera and behind the camera, that we win this award.  I want to thank in particular my partner Carol, my beautiful daughter Danielle, and my eighty-seven-year-old dad who's out there in the back somewhere here to celebrate this with us.  I want to thank also J.R.R. Tolkien, and also the fans that supported us on this journey.  And of course Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne, whose courageous venture allowed us to make this film and their support throughout the journey.  And Mark Ordesky, who worked alongside of us throughout and became a great friend.  And of course to Peter Jackson, who was never satisfied with 100 percent, but by his example of pushing for 110 percent, he inspired all of us to do our utmost to make these films and bring them to the screen.  And finally, to Weta, who is in Chicago [Sports Café] in Wellington, New Zealand, and to the production team, who are in the Port Nicholson Yacht Club--it's time to celebrate.

And those are a lot of qualities I saw in June Carter.  And people used to ask June how she was doing, and she used to say: ""I'm just trying to matter.""  And I know what she means.

Thank you to the Academy.  The duty of art is to send light into the darkness of men's hearts.  Thank you, Annie Proulx—she's right over there—for trusting us with your brilliant short story.  Thank you to Ang Lee and our brilliant cast for breathing life into our words.  Thank you to Universal; Focus Features; Bill Pohlad; Michael Costigan, my dear friend; my good friend Mark Poirier for giving me ""The New Yorker"" that had that short story in it.  And thank you to my writing partner, Larry.  And thank you for giving him this award as well.

LARRY McMURTRY:
Since somehow I unaccountably failed to thank my brilliant partner Diana at the Golden Globes, I'm going to rattle off all the attributes I was going to thank her for at the Golden Globes:  Smarts, guts, drive, good judgment, tenacity, loyalty, and generosity.  That's the kind of virtues you need in the rough strife of moviemaking.  I'd like to thank also James and Curtis, my son and grandson, with love and pride.  I thank our loyal lawyers Robert Thorne and Greg Redlitz.  And finally I'm going to thank all the booksellers of the world.  Remember that ""Brokeback Mountain"" was a book before it was a movie. From the humblest paperback exchange to the masters of the great bookshops of the world, all are contributors to the survival of the culture of the book, a wonderful culture, which we mustn't lose.  Thank you.

I've got my purse in one hand, my earring in the other. Thank you, Academy. Thank you so much. Huge honor. You know my sister told me that all kids love to get gold stars and this is the biggest and the best gold star that I have ever had in my life. I want to share my gold star with my fellow nominees, those brilliant, brilliant actresses who gave such amazing performances this year. I also share my gold star with the filmmakers: with Stephen Frears, with Peter Morgan, with Andy Harries, and all the producers and all the filmmakers and the cast. Thank you.

Now, you know for fifty years and more Elizabeth Windsor has maintained her dignity, her sense of duty and her hairstyle. She's had her feet planted firmly on the ground, her hat on her head, her handbag on her arm and she's weathered many, many storms. And I salute her courage and her consistency and I thank her, because if it wasn't for her, I most, most certainly would not be here. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you The Queen. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Oh my God. I have to just take this moment in. I cannot believe this. Look what God can do. If my grandmother--I didn't think I was going to win but, wow, if my grandmother was here to see me now. She was my biggest inspiration for everything because she was a singer, and she had the passion for it but she never had the chance, and that was the thing that pushed me forward to continue. But I'm so grateful to have my mother here celebrating with me. My boyfriend, my sisters and my brothers back home, and then I've got two of them here, thank you all for being here and supporting me. Also I'd like to thank Bill Condon, our director, who's a genius. Wow. Oh my God. Unbelievable cast. I'd like to thank the Academy. Definitely have to thank God, I guess, again. I can't believe this. Wow, I don't know what to say but I thank you all for helping me keep the faith even when I didn't believe. Thank you and God bless you all. [Music begins] Jennifer Holliday, too!

I want to thank Francis, first of all, for introducing me to Sofia when we were doing ""Cotton Club."" And she was this [motions to her height as a girl], and now she's my director. I think she did a wonderful movie; her movie is like a poem and she inspired me. I haven't prepared this speech so I have to hurry up because Marshall, my husband, said I have to get out of here quickly. So I want to thank everybody who had anything to do with this movie. Without them I wouldn't be here, and it's a communal effort, therefore thank everybody very, very much. I want to dedicate this award first of all to Momma, then Hugh Hudson, and Stanley Kubrick, my great master. Without them, I wouldn't be here.  Thank you.

2006,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,None,Sherry Lansing," SHERRY LANSING:
I am deeply honored and very grateful to receive this award, but I also must admit that it feels a little strange to be singled out; so many of you have causes that you are equally passionate about. That is really what is so wonderful about the movie industry, not only do we get to make films that matter, but we also work in a culture where we are encouraged to speak out. We may not always agree, but we do always care.

Through my work I have met scientists who struggle every day to find cures for diseases.  They do so quietly, without glamour or attention, but always with passion and conviction. I have met school teachers who are battling against insurmountable odds, and yet they never stop trying to reach our children. To me they are the real heroes, and tonight I share this honor with all of them.

On a personal note, I want to thank my husband Billy and our two boys, Cedric and Jack, whose unconditional love gives me the courage to fight every day for what I believe in. And a special thank you to the members of the Academy for this extraordinary honor. I promise to spend the rest of my life trying to live up to it.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.

This is dedicated to two people who are no longer with us:  Dilawar, the young Afghan taxi driver; and my father, a Navy interrogator who urged me to make this film because of his fury about what was being done to the rule of law.

I'm very lucky to have been given ""Hanna Schmitz"" by Bernhard Schlink and David Hare.  And Stephen, working with you is an experience I will never forget.  There was no division between the cast and the crew on this film, and that's what made it so special.  So, to have been surrounded by a remarkable group of people who provided an unbroken chain of support, from David Kross to Ralph Fiennes, Bruno Ganz, Lena Olin, from hair and makeup to cinematography, from the art department to the ADs, and from New York to Berlin.

Four of them, that I've fallen deeply in love with, I share this night with and I share this award with.  Gabby, I love you so much. You are exquisite.  You are beyond words to me.  Carey, your grace and your elegance and your beauty and your talent makes me sick.  Helen, I feel like we are family, through(?) family, and I don't have the words to express just what I think of you.  And Meryl, you know what I think of you, and you are such a good kisser.

I have so many people to thank for my good fortune in this lifetime, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I know.  To the family that allowed me to play them, the Tuohy family.  I know they're in here and you'll probably hear her in a minute... Maybe not. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to the family that made this film, that gave me the opportunity to do something different:  John Lee Hancock, Gil Netter, Alcon, Warner Bros., the actors. Everyone who's shown me kindness when it wasn't fashionable, I thank you.  To everyone who was mean to me when it wasn't... like George Clooney threw me in a pool years ago.  I'm still holding a grudge.

But there's so many people to thank; not enough time.  So I would like to thank what this film was about for me, which are the moms that take care of the babies and the children no matter where they come from.  Those moms and parents never get thanked.  I, in particular, failed to thank one.  So... if I can take this moment to thank Helga B. for not letting me ride in cars with boys till I was eighteen, 'cause she was right; I would've done what she said I was gonna do.  For making me practice every day when I got home, piano, ballet, whatever it is I wanted to be.  She said to be an artist you had to practice every day.  And for reminding her daughters that there's no race, no religion, no class system, no color, nothing, no sexual orientation, that makes us better than anyone else.  We are all deserving of love.  So, to that trailblazer who allowed me to have that, and this [referring to the Oscar], and this, I thank you so much for this opportunity that I share with these extraordinary women, and my lover Meryl Streep.

And, you know, we had this fantasy of making our film our way with the talent that we hoped to have, and hopefully we would find a distributor and somebody might even like the movie. So to be standing here, this was really, truly, honestly never part of anything we even imagined in our wildest dreams.  So thank you so much to each and every member of the Academy for really honoring us beyond anything we could've imagined.

2009,Honorary Award,None,To Lauren Bacall in recognition of her central place in the golden age of motion pictures.," LAUREN BACALL:
[Yells; laughs.]  Oh my heavens, I can't believe it.  [Clutching the Oscar:] A man at last! [Laughs.] Well this is quite an event, I must say.  This was something I never expected.  I was in total shock when I got the call, and the shock has not quite worn off, I have to say.

I've been very lucky in my life, probably luckier than I deserve.  But to, at the age of nineteen, have been chosen by Howard Hawks to work in a film with a man named Humphrey Bogart, didn't thrill me too much when I heard it.  I thought, Bogart, God...dese dem and dose guys, can't, you know... I thought that was not for me.  He had said, ""Maybe Cary Grant.""  I said, ""Well!  Now you're talking.""  But it ended up being Bogart; that was my great luck. Because he was not only a wonderful actor, but he was an extraordinary man. And he gave me a life and he changed my life.  And he told me about all the ins and outs and ups and downs, of which there were many.  And not so many downs with him.  And from then on, I must say, for as many years as, I cannot believe sixty years, but it has been that long.  [Laughs.]  It's amazing, isn't it?  Considering how young I am.  Anyway.  Miracles will never cease.

The fact is that I've had the great good fortune of not only being shown the way by Bogie, and having two wonderful children who are right here, Steve and Leslie, right here with me, but in also being able to work with some of the best leading men in this business.  And have forged the greatest friendships with Greg Peck, who I miss very much and love very dearly.  And his wife got in the way, but what are you gonna do? [Laughs.] And anyway.  Veronique, hello! [Laughs.]

Anyway, I really was lucky.  I really did work with, with Kirk – and he said, ""Never fear,"" he said to me backstage, ""Never fear, Kirk is here.""  Confidence is a great thing, isn't it?  But Kirk, and Duke Wayne, surprisingly had a marvelous relationship with him for two movies.  And Greg.  It's quite amazing the people that I've worked with.  I've worked with Hank Fonda and met – unfortunately not really Jimmy Stewart, but some of the all-time all-time greats.  And was directed by not only Howard Hawks, who was a marvelous director, a great movie director, but John Huston, of course, who was the great director and who showed me the way, and tripped me a few times en route. But he was a jokester, and because – and he loved to laugh, and he had an incredible laugh so one could hardly blame him.

But anyway, not to tell you the entire story of my life, I just must say that I have to thank the Academy and I'm very grateful that they think I'm deserving of this honor.  And as I repeat, I certainly did not expect to receive it, but I do welcome it.  And the thought when I get home that I'm gonna have a two-legged man in my room is so exciting I can hardly stand it. So I would like to thank all of you, and I thank them.  And, what else can I say?  It's what I feel, and I feel very emotional and I feel very grateful, and not least of all that I'm still alive.  I mean after all, some of you are surprised, aren't you?  Nevertheless I am, and I'm here to stay.  You better get used to the idea.  Thank you very much.

We all work in what I think is the only true modern art form.  All other arts had their origins in antiquity and are therefore, to a certain extent, static. Motion pictures encompass movement, which is one of the key characteristics of our day, and for that reason they are modern.  There's another reason as well. And the reason is that traditional art has been done, let us say, by composers, writers, poets, painters, who could create their art individually. Motion pictures require, the filmmaker requires a cast and a crew, and they must be paid.  As a result our art is somewhat compromised.  We're compromised between art and business and I think that represents something of the compromised world in which we live.

I think that to succeed in this world you have to take chances.  Many of my friends and compatriots and people who've started with me are here tonight, and they've all succeeded.  Some of them succeeded to an extraordinary degree. And I believe they've succeeded because they had the courage to take chances, to gamble.  But they gambled because they knew the odds were with them; they knew they had the ability to create what they wanted to make.  It's very easy for a major studio or somebody else to repeat their successes, to spend vast amounts of money on remakes, on special effects-driven tentpole franchise films.  But I believe the finest films being done today are done by the original, innovative filmmakers who have the courage to take a chance and to gamble.  So I say to you: Keep gambling, keep taking chances.  Thank you.

2009,Honorary Award,None,"To Gordon Willis for unsurpassed mastery of light, shadow, color and motion."," GORDON WILLIS:
Vilmos [Zsigmond] said I shouldn't drop this [referring to the Oscar], so I'm gonna put it down I think.  I don't think I should be up here without a bulletproof vest on after Caleb's thing.

Thank you very much.  I have one disappointment.  I've done a lot of things in this business, but I've never worked for Roger Corman.  And after I thought about it, it's the best thing that ever happened to him.  I can't see too well anymore, unfortunately [pulling out his notes]; I made my own little thing up here.

My life in this business has been a series of, sort of great encounters, and they have been an embarrassment of riches as they say.  I've always had an opportunity to do what I want, and the way I want, and I've always worked with the people that have given me that opportunity.  In retrospect, I think probably every good thing that's ever happened to me happened because of another person.  And fifty-four years ago, I met this darling girl and married her, had three kids, now five grandchildren, and along the way I met this remarkable group of directors, producers, very fine actors, and very fine technicians who extended themselves for me.  And I can never really give them back what they gave to me; I had the best of it.

To the Academy, thank you very much.  I really appreciate this.  And a remark on a lighter vein.  All the beautiful women that I worked with in this business that were terrified of looking like Marlon Brando; it's okay, it's over now.  You're safe.  And to all of you, do your best, take care of your kids.  Thank you very much.

Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much to the Academy.  This is insane and I truly, sincerely wish that the prize tonight was to get to work with my fellow nominees.  I'm so in awe of you.  I am so grateful to get to do the job that I do.  I love it so much.  I want to thank my parents, who are right there, first and foremost for giving me my life and for giving me the opportunity to work from such an early age, and showing me every day how to be a good human being by example.

And I want to thank my team who works with me every day.  Aleen Keshishian, my manager for eighteen years.  And my agents, Kevin Huvane and everyone at CAA.  Bryna and Tamar at I/D.  My friends, who are everything to me no matter what's going on in my career.  And everyone who's ever hired me:  Luc Besson, who gave me my first job when I was eleven years old; Mike Nichols, who has been my hero and my champion for the past decade; and now Darren Aronofsky. You are a fearless leader, a visionary.  I am blessed to have just gotten to get to work with you every day for the period of time we did.

So many people helped me prepare for this role.  Mary Helen Bowers spent a year with me, training me.  Michelle Rodriguez, and Kurt Froman, and Olga Kostritzky, Marina Stavitskaya, and my beautiful love, Benjamin Millepied, who choreographed the film and has now given me my most important role of my life. And also there are people on films that no one ever talks about that are your heart and soul every day.  Margie and Geordie, who did my hair and makeup; Nicci, who dressed me; and Kate and Laura Mulleavy, who designed the beautiful ballet costumes.  Joe Reidy, our incredible AD, first AD.  And our camera operators, J.C. and Steve, you gave me so much soul behind the camera every day and you gave me all of your energy.  Most importantly, my family, my friends, and my love.  Thank you so much.

Thank you to the Academy and especially to my fellow nominees who are just so much fun to sit with at the, tonight and have been so supportive.  It's great to be part of such a great group of people.  The story ""Alice in Wonderland"" was described by its publisher in 1865 as a story valued for its rare imagination, priceless humor, and power to transport the reader into a world of pure fantasy; a gift to us all.  The heart of any movie lies with the director and I've been incredibly lucky on this and many films to work with the singular Tim Burton.  Tim's imagination along with the amazing cast – Johnny's incandescent ""Hatter,"" Mia's ""Alice"" for all girls all times, Helena's the fearless, big-headed queen, and our crystalline snowflake princess Anne Hathaway – made my job a delight.  We had the support of a production team headed by Richard Zanuck and Katterli Frauenfelder, supported by Joe Roth, Suzanne and Jen Todd, and Disney, but I couldn't have done it without my team: Christine Cantella and my entire group.  Thank you all very much.

2011,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,None,Oprah Winfrey," OPRAH WINFREY:
I didn't prepare a speech because I just wanted to feel whatever this is. Because Maria is so correct, it's very difficult for me to open myself to receive what people have to offer. And so tonight I came prepared to be open, and I would like to thank the Board of Governors for the opportunity to receive the love, and the Oscar.

I never imagined myself receiving an Oscar, certainly not for doing what I believe is a part of my calling, is a part of my being. It's a part of why I am here. And what I know for sure is the only reason I am here is because Quincy Jones was in a hotel in Chicago in 1985, and was taking a shower, and was there for a lawsuit, that somebody was suing Michael Jackson saying that they were the girl of the song, or whatever. And he saw me on ""A.M. Chicago"" and said, ""I think that's Sofia."" So I would like to thank Quincy Jones, who is in Dubai right now.

But Quincy Jones was a part of a divine manifestation for me. Those of you, anybody here who's ever watched ""The Oprah Show"" has heard me tell the story of how I first watched, first read The New York Times review on a Sunday about ""The Color Purple."" I read the review, because the book review is the first thing I ever look at on The New York Times. And Stedman and I to this day, it's like, ""You want the book review?"" I go, ""You read the front section. I'll read the book review first."" And I read the book review of ""The Color Purple."" And was in my pajamas, put on my coat, in Baltimore, and went to the bookstore and got the book. And from that moment became, literally, drawn to, in some kind of mystical way, to that story. Mainly because the character... The first line of the book is, ""Dear God, I'm fourteen years old..."" And I had lived that life and couldn't imagine that someone was able to put into words what I had already experienced.

And so began this journey that I was able to really understand that God's hand, or power greater than myself, ""the forces,"" as Sidney Poitier calls them, were engaged in leading my life to a plane and a level that I had not even imagined. But I released myself to those forces, and literally said inside myself, ""Thy will be done."" And as a part of that journey, to be here tonight... Maria touched on it but it is really -- Stedman and I talk about this all the time. It's unimaginable if you are not a black, former colored girl, born in Mississippi in 1954, it's impossible for you to even know what this journey has meant. I know Larry Gordon, Mississippi Jew [laughs], almost as rare as I am [laughs], can begin to understand what that means, to be born in 1954 in Mississippi.

When I saw ""The Help,"" and first heard that there was gonna be a movie called ""The Help,"" and first read the book, ""The Help,"" I thought that is my story. My grandmother was a maid. Her mother was a maid. The mother before her was a slave. My mother was a maid. My grandmother's greatest dream for me was that I would grow up in a family and have a career where... She used to say, ""I hope you get some good white folks. I hope you get some good white folks like I have. I have good white folks."" And the only picture I have of my grandmother is of her holding a white child in her maid's uniform. So, the journey from Kosciusko, Mississippi, where nobody ever even imagined it possible that you could be anything other than a maid who had some good white folks, who would give you clothes and would let you take food home on the holidays. It's unimaginable that I would be standing before you, voted by the Board of Governors... It's unimaginable. It's unimaginable. It's unimaginable. It is unimaginable! And so when I say thank you, the thank you comes from a place deeper than even I know, Sharon [Stone]. Even deeper than I know. Because it's not just from me, it's from everybody who made me possible. It's from every shoulder I ever stood on, every bridge I ever crossed, every story that's ever told, every story that ever imagined this day to be possible.

I thank you for this award. And I will... What this means for me is, I woke up this morning, I said, ""What is Oscar? What is a... Oscar...?"" You know, I grew up wanting to be an actress and my father, being a barber and coming from the culture that he came from, said, ""No daughter of mine's going to be laying on some casting couch."" That was his idea of what being an actress meant. And so when the opportunity showed itself to me, to be a part of ""The Color Purple,"" it really is, was divine intervention, just to be a part of being able to share that story. I knew that something special, magical, a door had opened to me. And after that door came ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" and many other doors. But a door opened to me through the magic and majesty of film. The ability to tell stories in such a way that you connect to the heart-space of people, and you connect to the place where people really live, and not just live but where their souls abide, that is what great films do. And to this day, ""The Color Purple"" experience is one of the greatest experiences of my life.

And yes, I'd like to do more films, but to receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award means more to me than any film, any acclaim, even an Oscar. Because what it says is that you all get it. The Board of Governors, you get it. You get that what I've been trying to do and what I've been trying to say all these years is that every single person, Ayanna, and all of you and every person I've spoken to in over fifty thousand interviews of ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" every single person who incarnates here to the planet matters. Your life matters. You matter. What you do matters. The fact that you are here, that you are born, that your presence here on earth means something. That's what I've been trying to say through all of my work, be it film, be it ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" be it the magazine, it is that we all matter. And what I really, really, really, really know for sure, is that this award to me represents all of you, sitting in a room -- I don't know how this happens. The governors, I don't know who you are. But when I got the call from Tom [Sherak] I was literally on a hike in Hawaii, and I get the call. The Academy has called! Security comes for me and says, ""You must come down from the mountain now! Stop the hike because Tom from the Academy is on the phone."" And then Larry Gordon is saying, ""Answer the phone! Answer the phone!"" And I'm like, whaaat...? Okay! What this really means is that you all understand that what I've been trying to do and what I've tried to say all these years, is that all us can make a difference through the life that we live.

And when you understand, as I do, that this to me, I'm gonna allow this Oscar... Like I've interviewed everybody over the years and say, ""Where do you keep your Oscar?"" And people are always so nonchalant about it and they say: ""Oh my, I keep it in my bathroom."" ""I don't know where mine is."" ""My sister has it."" Well my new sister, my sister who I just discovered last year, this time last year, is here. Pat is here. I will say she will not have it; I will have it! And it will be on, I will keep it on my desk in front of me to remind me that you have voted for me. You have voted for what I believe is the essence of why we're all here. We're all here to help each other. We're all here to use our lives in service to one another. And nobody who has ever, ever done any kind of work... I mean I run a girls school and those girls are gonna be graduating from college. The first in their families to ever graduate from college. The first in their families to ever graduate high school. And those girls are coming to the United States and they're going to Wellesley and they're going to Brown and they're going to Tufts and they're going to all the great universities. And I will tell you that anybody who's ever done that, done any kind of work where you are hands on, where you're up on the phone and you're on at four o'clock in the morning and two in the morning and whatever, you're not doing that because you think you're gonna get an Oscar one day. You're doing it because you believe in the power of every human being who has come to this planet. And you know that these are all bodies, but inside the bodies there's a soul and a spirit and a power greater than we know. And for me this Oscar will represent love from all of you. I thank you for your vote of love and I will use it to increase the open space in my heart to continue to do the great and good work that we've all come to do and serve. Thank you so much.

To the Academy, thank you. This is such an honor. Kathryn, what a fantastic movie. And my crew. I was fortunate to be here a few years ago for a movie called ""Hurt Locker"" and I was awarded two of these. I woke up in the morning, seven o'clock, where our son has said, ""One for mommy, one for daddy."" He looked at me and said, ""Where's mine?"" And Theo, I love you. Karen, I love you. Mom watching at home, I love you. My dad, with God now, I love you. I miss you. Good night. Thank you.

2013,Actress in a Leading Role,Blue Jasmine,Cate Blanchett," CATE BLANCHETT:
Sit down; you're too old to be standing. Thank you, Mr. Day-Lewis. From you it exacerbates this honor to it and it blows it right out of the ballpark. Thank you so much to the Academy. As random and as subjective as this award is, it means a great deal in a year of extraordinary – yet again – extraordinary performances by women. Amy Adams, everything you do, but your performance in ""American Hustle"" blew my mind. And Meryl, what can I say? Sandra, I could watch that performance to the end of time, and I sort of felt like I had. Julia, #suckit. You know what I mean? And Judi Dench, I mean what a career. She's not here tonight because at the age of 79 her film was so successful that she's in India doing a sequel. I mean what a career that is, if I could hope.

And me, I'm here accepting an award in an extraordinary screenplay by Woody Allen. Thank you so much, Woody, for casting me. I truly appreciate it. I'm so very proud that ""Blue Jasmine"" stayed in the cinemas for as long as it did. And thank you to Sony Classics, to Michael and Tom, for their extraordinary support, for so bravely and intelligently distributing the film. And to the audiences who went to see it, and perhaps those of us in the industry who are still foolishly clinging to the idea that female films with women at the center are niche experiences. They are not. Audiences want to see them and, in fact, they earn money. So... The world is round, people!

Thank you to my mum, to my sister, to my brother, to my three glorious sons; I would not be standing here without you. To my husband Andrew, you are a legend. Thank you to my agent Hylda Queally; you're behind the pillar somewhere up there. You are a goddess. To my agent in Australia, Robyn Gardiner, I love you so very much. To my publicist Lisa Kasteler. To the sublime Sally Hawkins and to the extraordinary cast of ""Blue Jasmine,"" I don't know how to do this without other actors and this I share with you. To the hair and makeup people who sweated me up and tried to make me look attractive, thank you for the attempt. To Carla Meyer, for getting Sally and I together and for incredible support. To Helen Robin. To everyone involved in ""Blue Jasmine,"" I thank you so much.

And finally, I would like to thank every single member of the Sydney Theatre Company, one of the great theater companies in the world. For me working on ""Blue Jasmine,"" it was a real synthesis of my work in the theater and on film. And not only working with you for the last six years has been the most enormous privilege of my career, but it's made me a better actress. There is so much talent in Australia, and Michael Wilkinson and CM and I are just tonight's tip of the iceberg. Thank you so much. Thank you.

And so I want to salute the spirit of ""Patsey"" for her guidance. And for Solomon, thank you for telling her story and your own.

Steve McQueen, you charge everything you fashion with a breath of your own spirit. Thank you so much for putting me in this position; it has been the joy of my life. I'm certain that the dead are standing about you and watching and they are grateful and so am I. Chiwetel, thank you for your fearlessness and how deeply you went into telling Solomon's story.

Sean Bobbitt, Kalaadevi, Adruitha, Patty Norris, thank you, thank you, thank you. I could not be here without your work.

I want to thank my family for your training, and the Yale School of Drama as well for your training. My friends, the Wilsons, this one's for you. My brother Junior, sitting by my side, thank you so much. You are my best friend. And Ben, my other best friend, my chosen family.

Oh wow. I'm sorry. I apologize for the paper but otherwise I'll just bore you all. Well, maybe I'll do the same now but I'll try not to. I'd first like to thank the Academy. Thank you so much.

2013,Honorary Award,None,"To Angela Lansbury, an entertainment icon who has created some of cinema's most memorable characters, inspiring generations of actors."," ANGELA LANSBURY:
Oh, you have no idea. Oh my God. Oh, this is so marvelous. Thank you. Oh, this is amazing; what an incredible moment. Gosh. What an eleven o'clock number! Oh wow.

You know, when I was first asked by the Academy who I would like to introduce me, I thought carefully and I came to a conclusion that the one person who really knew about my early work was Robert, Robert Osborne. I mean, so many of the legendary directors and producers who gave me such incredible opportunities in film, they were long gone, you know. I was still around. But thanks to Turner Classic Movies and Robert those great films are shown and studied and discussed by students everywhere, as well as seen by a huge general audience. So, thank you, TMC, and thank you, Robert, for keeping me alive all these years. [Laughs]

Emma, bless your heart. ""Aunt Adelaide"" was a wonderful moment for me because I had sort of pulled out completely of everything when my darling husband Peter died. And you, by inviting me to play the dreaded ""Aunt Adelaide,"" you simply helped me get back on track. And I am incredibly indebted to you for that.

You know, during the long course of my career in film and television and theater I have known and worked with the very best of their time. You know, Ingrid Bergman, that beautiful, lovely woman. Bette Davis, crazy, wonderful dame. Kate Hepburn, [makes a growling noise] you know...I give her credit, really, for getting me into the part...she really got me the part in ""State of the Union."" I don't think I ever would have got it without her help. And, you know, people like Orson Welles and Laurence Olivier and Frank Sinatra, Paul Newman and Spencer Tracy. James Earl Jones, who I just completed a six-month tour of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in Australia with; which was a fantastic experience. And I must tell you, I even had coffee in the MGM commissary with Clark Gable. That's as far as it went, you understand. But we were on the lot together. I once saw him driving down Sunset Blvd., I'll never forget, in a dark brown Mercedes convertible. I never got over it. And when I could afford it I got the same car in dark brown [laughs] and drove it for years until it was stolen.

But how would I have even begun my career in ""Gaslight"" without the belief of the great directors of that time, in that case, of course, George Cukor. Or Arthur [sic] Lewin in ""The Picture of Dorian Gray."" Or been given the incredible role of ""Mrs. Iselin"" in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" by the great John Frankenheimer, whose widow is here with me tonight, bless her heart. And I'm so proud that she is. I just couldn't top that role, so I took off for Broadway and musical comedy by way of Stephen Sondheim's ""Anyone Can Whistle"" and Jerry Herman's ""Mame.""

Now, movies have taken a bit of a back seat since then, except of course for darling ""Mrs. Potts"" and ""Eglantine Price."" But in 1984, I came back to Universal City and I stayed around for twelve years playing ""Jessica Fletcher"" in ""Murder, She Wrote."" The interesting thing is that ""Murder, She Wrote"" has given me more worldwide attention than any role I ever played in movies or on the stage [laughs]. And it's a wonderful thing to be known, you know, in Spain and Portugal and Paris and France and Germany and everywhere, and, you know, to have a whole kind of worldwide career. That's what television does for you if have a hit show, and we did.

You know, you can't imagine how happy and proud, indeed I feel really undeserving of this gorgeous golden chap. And I want to thank the Governors' Honorary Oscar from the Academy tonight, and to be here in the company of my beloved family and friends instead of sitting, shivering with hope and then disappointment in Grauman's Chinese Theatre in the 1940s and 60s – yeah. Sharing this wonderful occasion with me tonight are my twin brothers Edgar and Bruce Lansbury, who traveled with me and our mother Moyna to this great country as evacuees from England in 1940. And my sons Anthony and David, and my darling daughter Deirdre, and my wonderful grandchildren Peter, Katherine and Ian. Let me tell ya, it doesn't get much better than that. Thank you.

2013,Honorary Award,None,To Steve Martin in recognition of his extraordinary talents and the unique inspiration he has brought to the art of motion pictures.," STEVE MARTIN:
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. This is so nice, so nice of you. Ladies and gentlemen, it has been a longtime dream of mine that I would one day receive an Honorary Oscar, and tonight I feel I am one step closer to that dream. [Tom Hanks walks over to the podium to take a picture of himself with Martin.] Oh, cool. Hey! Thanks [laughs]. So now it's just, the class level has dropped completely. I can't possibly express how excited I am tonight, because the Botox is fresh. You know, it is said that the art and craft of filmmaking is collaborative, so to be singled out and rewarded tonight means that that is not true. [Looking around the room:] Is it my imagination or is this year's Oscar ceremony a little on the cheap side?

I must thank the people who spoke on my behalf tonight. My high school friend Bill Taylor. Bill – by the way, he was a distinguished visual effects artist and cinematographer – whoever thought we would meet more than fifty years later on such an auspicious stage. Congratulations on your life and career too, Bill. And following Bill, a comedian so renowned and funny, whose work has only grown over the years and who never fails to make us laugh in new and unique ways; if only we had had someone like that tonight. You should have seen Marty Short's face fall when I told him the gift basket was taxable. And then the beautiful speech by Tom Hanks. Thank you, Tom. Everybody loves Tom Hanks. What a talent. Tom Hanks...Tom Hanks...I saw ""Captain Phillips."" I didn't think it was so funny.

But seriously, I have so many people in my career to mention and thank. My very first manager back in the sixties, Bill McEuen. My first two agents, Marty Klein and John Gaines; some of you may remember them. John Gaines was all business. One time he called me and he said, ""Steve, two things. One: hello..."" Carl Reiner. How lucky was I to get with Carl Reiner, who taught me so much about how to work on a script. David Picker. Michael Gendler, my lawyer for over, I think it's thirty years is it, Michael? Something like that. I stick with people until they die. Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer. Nora Ephron. Frank Griffin, my makeup man for over – how many? Twenty years? More than that, more than that. Dan Melnick, a producer who had a great eye for a script. Fred Schepisi, who directed ""Roxanne."" John Hughes, who wrote and directed ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles."" I read the first script and it was, the first script was 165 pages long. I loved the script. I said to John, ""What are you thinking about cutting?"" And he said, ""Cutting?"" The first cut of the film was 4½ hours long.

Phil Robinson, who's here tonight, and wrote ""All of Me,"" which absolutely changed my career. Brian Grazer, another producer who kept his eye on the script. Ron Howard. David Mamet. Larry Kasdan, the great Larry Kasdan. Frank Oz, who's here tonight, who did so much great comedies, some of my best comedies with him. Mick Jackson, who directed ""L.A. Story."" John Landis, who directed the little movie that could, the ""¡Three Amigos!."" Bob Simonds. Ed Limato, God rest his soul. Adam Venit. So many of my agents have died; watch out, Adam. My wife Anne Stringfield, who is as beautiful as she is smart. And...hey [begins to tear up]. I knew I wasn't going to make it through this speech. I read it to my dog this morning and wept. My wife alone would have been enough reward for my life but now she has brought me a wonderful child. And for some mysterious reason she really loves that child. I don't know; I don't get it.

In 2008, Nancy Meyers asked me to appear in ""It's Complicated"" with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. And I hadn't done a movie in a long while and I didn't really know how I felt about them anymore. Because along with the joy that they had brought me over the past thirty-four years, people in this room know they also bring an equal amount of artistic heartache. And I went out to the set, across the Queensboro Bridge, on that cold winter morning. And on the first day of shooting I opened the door to the dark soundstage, and I stepped over all those black snaking electric cables, and walked past the craft service table that overflowed with boxes of raisins and bagels and muffins, and the slowest toaster in the world, and jars of M&M's and Twizzlers for breakfast, and every variety of mustard. And as I made this little journey that I had made a thousand times at every studio in this city, walking through the corridors, through this flimsy plywood flats, and the light changing from pitch black to blinding white, I thought: Home. So to get an award for something that you realize has seeped into your bones and to understand tonight that the work over the decades has at least meant something to someone is especially satisfying.

But working in the movies has also brought something, an amazing gift, that has accummulated through these decades of filmmaking that cannot be matched, something wonderful and magical and its impact on my life is profound. Friends – fascinating, funny, and lifelong. Many of them are here in this room tonight. So thank you, movies, and thank you, Academy, for this award and a glorious reminder of the true benefit that I have received.

2013,Honorary Award,None,"To Piero Tosi, a visionary whose incomparable costume designs shaped timeless, living art in motion pictures. (not present; accepted by Claudia Cardinale)"," CLAUDIA CARDINALE:
Well, Piero Tosi wishes he could be here tonight. He actually never traveled to the United States, a country he has above all known and loved through cinema. Piero is passionate about his work and therefore it is with great excitement that he received the news of this unexpected Honorary Award. An award for which he thank all of the Academy and which he accepts also thanks that through this recognition the Academy intended to bestow recognition to all those who work with behind the camera. Piero wishes to thank Deborah Landis for the dedication with which she change our work.

Though Piero is not here, at his table are many colleagues and fellow companions with which he feels to share this recognition: Ann Roth; Milena Canonero; Gabriella Pescucci; Dino Trappetti, CEO of Tirelli Costume House; and Carlo Poggioli. But Piero asked me, an actress, to collect this prize because he believes that the work of a costume designer is mainly dedicated to us, the actors. I suspect that he choose me because he think he made me suffer a lot during the ten films we did together, even if he said something different. ""Dear Claudia, please go to pick up my prize. With you there will be 'Angelica' and 'Bianca,' 'The Leopard' and 'La viaccia,' Visconti and Bolognini, and all the Italian cinema to which I have devoted my entire career."" On behalf of Piero, thank you very much.

Thank you so much. I read an article that said that winning an Oscar could lead to living five years longer. If that's true, I'd really like to thank the Academy because my husband is younger than me. There's no such thing as best actress, as is evidenced by the performances of my fellow nominees. I've been honored to be among you every step of the way. I am grateful for this and grateful for the opportunity to stand up here and thank people that I love. My manager Evelyn O'Neill, Kevin Huvane, Steven Huvane, Josh Lieberman. My family: my grandparents, my brother Peter, my sister Valerie, my mother and father who told me that I could be whatever I wanted to be if I got an education. Although I didn't think they meant being an actress. And I thank my dad for showing me the world.

I want to thank everybody who made this movie: Sony Classics, Killer Films, James Brown, Lex Lutzus, Lisa Genova, Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin. I'm so happy, I'm thrilled, actually, that we were able to hopefully shine a light on Alzheimer's disease. So many people with this disease feel isolated and marginalized, and one of the wonderful things about movies is it makes us feel seen and not alone. And people with Alzheimer's deserve to be seen, so that we can find a cure. And finally, to our filmmakers, Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, who had hoped to be here tonight but they can't because of Richard's health. When Richard was diagnosed with ALS, Wash asked him what he wanted to do. Did he want to travel? Did he want to see the world? And he said that he wanted to make movies, and that's what he did. And finally, for my husband Bart and our children, Cal and Liv, thank you for my life, thank you for giving me a home. Thank you very much for this.

2014,Short Film (Animated),Feast,Patrick Osborne and Kristina Reed," PATRICK OSBORNE:
Oh, man. The shorts are so freakin' amazing this year. Thank you, the Academy, for recognizing short animated films. They're my favorite thing to make and watch. Thanks, John Lasseter, Ed Catmull and Andrew Millstein, for letting me make my film. To Jeff Turley, my production designer, who's the best painter alive. And he's the reason that the short looks so great. And the rest of the crew at Disney Animation, you guys are the best, best in the business. And to my mom and dad, I love you. And everybody back in Cincinnati watching right now, and my beautiful wife Ali, thank you.

2014,Honorary Award,None,"To Jean-Claude Carrière, whose elegantly crafted screenplays elevate the art of screenwriting to the level of literature."," JEAN-CLAUDE CARRIÈRE:
Thank you so much, everybody. And thank you, Phil, for what you said and what you gave me. He has already said what I wanted to say first, that today it's my daughter's, Iris, birthday. Which is a strange coincidence. So allow me to say, Iris, bon anniversaire. And then, of course I'm very grateful to the members of the Academy for accepting me as a new member and this totally unexpected Oscar.

I think at the moment here tonight about some of the great directors I've been working with and who have already passed away. Like Luis Buñuel, of course, Jacques Tati, Louis Malle, Patrice Chéreau, Nagisa Ôshima, Marco Ferreri, Jacques Deray. They all taught me something, each of them. And they're always present, even today, even now in this moment, when I'm working and when I hear, I believe I hear their voices in my ears. In a way, they are all here tonight with us. And of course I think also about the directors who are still alive, like that one [pointing to Philip Kaufman onstage], and like Volker Schlöndorff that you saw in the film. Like Milos Forman, of course. Like Peter Brook, who is going to turn ninety pretty soon and still very much alive and working. So that's all I want to say. We – a screenwriter is nothing without a director. And with such directors as the ones I've been happy to work with, it's a gift. It's just a series of gifts.

Now I'd like also to say something about the fact that this Oscar goes to a screenwriter. And I'm very happy of this because very often the screenwriters are forgotten, are ignored. They are like shadows passing through [the] history of cinema. Their names do not appear in the reviews, very seldom, but still they are filmmakers. That's why tonight I like to share this priceless statue with all my colleagues – the ones I know, the ones I don't know – from all over the world to share with them. So we all thank you.

2014,Honorary Award,None,"To Hayao Miyazaki, a master storyteller whose animated artistry has inspired filmmakers and audiences around the world."," HAYAO MIYAZAKI (via translator):
My wife tells me that I'm a very lucky man. And I think I've been lucky because I've been able to participate in the last era when we can make films with paper, pencil, and film. Another fact of luck is that my country has not been at war for the fifty years that I have been making films. Of course we've profited from wars, but we're very fortunate that we have not had to go to war ourselves. But my greatest luck is that I've been able to meet Miss Maureen O'Hara today. So I've been so happy and feel so blessed with luck in my life. Thank you.

Charles Laughton, who signed me to my first movie contract and is totally responsible for my career. The Duke, John Wayne... [edit]. And of course, that old devil himself, the great John Ford. Pappy, we finally got an Oscar. I'd also like to say thank you to all my fans who have been so kind to me over the years and truly made this night possible.

I'm so proud to receive this award because it comes from my peers, who represent every element of the motion picture business. Believe me, the admiration is mutual. I am honored beyond words. Thank you with all my heart, and I'll leave you with this old Irish saying: May the road rise to meet you; the wind be always at your back; and may the sun shine warmly upon your face. Good night.

What another lovely day. Very quickly, if Iain Smith, our amazing executive producer from Scotland, hadn't sent me a text saying, ""whatcha doing at the moment?"" and then got me on a plane out to meet George Miller and Doug Mitchell, I wouldn't obviously be standing here. It was a year of our lives in the Namibian desert. We had the most amazing crew. I hope that some, I'd heard they were on ticker tape, I thought they'd, that the names were going on the screen. But honestly, if anybody wants to know more about any of them just get in touch with me through my wonderful agents Wayne Fitterman from William Morris and Sue Latimer from ARG. But it was an incredible experience. But I just want to say one quite serious thing and I've been thinking about this a lot. But actually it could be horribly prophetic, ""Mad Max,"" if we're not kinder to each other and if we don't stop polluting our atmosphere. So you know, it could happen.

So I want to thank Cheryl Boone Isaacs [Lee applauds], the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, trying to bring some flava up in here. We need some flava up in here! I want to thank the Board of Governors. I'm very sorry Debbie Reynolds is not here tonight, would have loved to meet her in person. And Gena [Lee applauds], it's an honor.

All right, I'm gonna take my time. As they say in church: Take your time.

SAMUEL L. JACKSON:
You mean like black church? Um-hmm.

SPIKE LEE:
A little bit. How'd I get here? Well, I was born in Atlanta, Georgia. I grew up in Brooklyn, New York. And my late mother, who died when I was in film school, she was the one that – her name is Jacquelyn Shelton Lee – she was the one that introduced me to film. My father, a great jazz musician, he hated movies, so I was my mother's date and she would drag me to movies. And so my introduction to Martin Scorsese was when she took me to see ""Mean Streets."" Went away to college, [pointing to presenter Samuel L. Jackson] alma mater, Sam, Morehouse College. I'm a third generation Morehouse man. My grandfather went to Morehouse. My father went to Morehouse; he was a freshman when Martin Luther King was a senior. And my grandmother and my mother went to Spelman. These are two historic black schools across from each other, across the street from each other, in Atlanta, Georgia. Of course, Sam's wife is from Spelman.

When I went to college I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I had to go to college, I had to go to Morehouse. So my first two years I was... lost in the wilderness. I was a D-plus, C-minus student. It wasn't 'cause I wasn't smart, just not motivated. So at the end of my sophomore year my advisor said, before it's time to go back home for the summer, go back to New York, she said, ""You have to think long and hard about choosin' a major."" And I said, ""Why?"" She said, ""Because you've exhausted all your electives.""

So I came back to New York. The infamous summer of 1977. And I thought, up to that point you could always get a job in New York if you had your working papers, but that summer in 1977 New York City was broke. There's a famous Daily News front page: ""Ford to City"" – that's President Ford – ""Ford to City: Drop Dead."" There were no jobs. So I did not want to sit on my stoop and play Strat-O-Matic Baseball all summer – no one heard about Strat-, no one played Strat-O-Matic Baseball back here? Come on! [Lee applauds.] Somebody! Anyway. My team was the 1953 Brooklyn Dodgers. So that summer... it was crazy. It's really crazy because that summer I ended up making a film about that summer, Summer of Sam, so you never know how this stuff works.

So one day I'm on my stoop – we call 'em stoops, not porches, in Brooklyn. And I'm gonna say let me go see my friend Vietta Davis. Now, she was very smart. New York City public high school is like this: Stuyverson, Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech. And she was a genius. I mean, right then and there she knew she wanted to be a doctor, ended going to Princeton, then Harvard Med School. She's a doctor now in Chicago. Anyway, I'm gonna say let me see what she's doing. So I go to her house and I ring the bell, and she says come on up. And we're sittin' in the living room, and in the corner is a box. And I say, ""What's in the box?"" She says, ""A Super 8 camera. I'm gonna be a doctor so you can have it."" Then I say, ""What's in the other box?"" She says, ""That's film for a Super 8 camera. I'm gonna be a doctor, you can have it.""

So, now I have something to do for the summer. I was not gonna play Start-O-Matic Baseball on the stoop all summer. And so it was a great summer to shoot because a couple of days later there was a blackout. It's a blackout, and so my father drove me around – we had a Citroën, yellow Citroën station wagon. So when my fellow brothers and sisters and my fellow Puerto Rican brothers and sisters started to loot, I filmed it. I went up to 125th St., Harlem, filmed the looting. Went into Fulton St. in Brooklyn. Choice items were color TVs, washin' machines, Pampers and Walt Frazier Clyde Pumas. And so I filmed that. And then that summer, in summer 1977, was the first summer of disco. So every block, weekends, people hookin' up their turntable and speakers to the street lamps, I was filming that. And then there was a guy named David Berkowitz, Son of Sam. So he had most of New York terrified. See, this is before gentrification. So back in 1977, if Son of Sam were to come into Harlem, Bed-Stuy, they would have killed him. Before – way, way back before gentrification.

So I have all this footage and I go back to school and I say, I'm gonna be a mass communications major. And there's a teacher there, who's still teachin' there today, his name's Dr. Herb Eichelberger. He encouraged me to make a documentary out of this footage. The film was called ""Last Hustle in Brooklyn."" From then, my junior and senior years, I was a A-plus student. I was C– [applause] ...yeah. But the reason why – I didn't get any smarter; I just was interested. So, I don't say I found film, film found me.

Moving forward. I graduate. I know that story about working your way up from the mailroom doesn't work for black people, so I say I'm gonna try to go to film school. So I apply to USC and AFI, and I don't get in USC or AFI because I don't have the astronomical score on a GRE. But lucky for me they had more forward thinking people at NYU, who said whether you get into film school or not shouldn't be determined by a standardized test. So I got in to NYU and that's where I met Ernest Dickerson. Great, great DP. Ernest and I were the only two people in the program. And we bonded automatically 'cause I went to Howard – excuse me – I went to Morehouse and he went to Howard. And here's the thing I'd like to say. The reason Ernest and I were successful, because our parents told us from a very early age that we had to be ten times better than our white classmates. That just being the same was not gonna be enough. That was instilled for me from the beginning. That we as a people here, if you're just trying to [Lee makes mid-level hand gesture]... nuh-huh. You gotta be better. You have to extra excel. You have to excel. So...

DENZEL WASHINGTON:
Nothing's changed.

SPIKE LEE:
Come on, ""Nothing's changed."" That's D right there, the man!

So! Three years of film school. I do a film, my thesis film is called ""Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop"" and it wins the Student Academy Award. I won the Student Academy Award back in 1983. So I had a agent. Man, I thought that Spielberg's gonna call me, Lucas, Fox, Universal. And I had a little apartment off Myrtle Ave. on Fort Greene, before gentrification. So I had my – now the Student Academy Award is not like this [pointing to the Oscar statuette]. It's a wooden box with a circle with this [the Oscar image] on it. So I know for sure, because I have a Student Academy Award, I'm gonna take over Hollywood. But a funny thing happens. When you don't pay Ma Bell, you don't pay Con Edison, and you don't pay Brooklyn Union Gas, the phone gets turned off, the heat gets turned off, and lights get turned off. So I was in the dark just by havin' my Student Academy Award. And then I woke up. And so that's when I learned a tough lesson: Nothin' happens overnight. There's no such thing as a overnight success. And that's the biggest thing we do to our young people, to tell them that there's a thing, a animal, as a overnight success. You have to bust your ass, roll up your sleeves and attack, attack, attack, attack, every single day. And that's what I've been tellin' my film students at NYU for the last 15 years.

[Looking down at his notes:] Let me turn a page here.

DENZEL WASHINGTON:
How many pages you got, Spike?

SPIKE LEE:
Two more, D! [Laughs.]  So, at this point...

WESLEY SNIPES:
I told you about patience, didn't I? I told you about having a lot of patience when you're working with this guy.

SPIKE LEE:
So, I'd like to say I'm very happy. You know, this is a great night. My family's here, and many friends, people I work with, but it's not been easy. And I'm just as proud – as this award – as a people, we got into this industry, behind and in front of the camera. That was always the goal. It's like, if I got in I was gonna try to bring as many mutherfuckers with me as possible. It'd be like Public Enemy, bum rush the show! 'Cause they're coming in here.

""Malcolm X."" We're gettin' ready to shoot ""Malcolm X,"" and we're meetin' with the Teamsters. I say, ""Sir –"" Tommy O'Donnell. I say, ""Sir, do you have any black Teamsters?"" He says, ""No."" I said, ""That's a problem."" I said, ""Until you get some black Teamsters, we're gonna have the Fruit of Islam drive trucks. And if you wanna come to the set and fuck with the Fruit of Islam, come on."" Next day five black Teamsters showed up. But some people don't do that. But I don't care about that, I knew I had to make changes like that or we wouldn't be where we are today.

In closing... [Lee looks at audience and applauds.] In closing – I always say this, but if it's been redundant then please forgive me. I wanna thank my grandmother – Sam, you met my grandmother – Zimmie Shelton Lee. Her grandmother was a slave, yet she graduated with a college degree. And for 50 years she taught art. Van Gogh was her favorite painter. For 50 years she taught art in the state of Georgia. And for 50 years she never had one white student because of Jim Crow laws in that state, and for 50 years white students missed on a great art teacher. And for 50 years my grandmother saved her social security checks for her grandchildren's education. And since I was the first born, I had first dibs. So my grandmother, through 50 years of saving her social security checks, put me through Morehouse, put me through NYU Film School, gave me the money for my thesis film, and then gave me the money for ""She's Gotta Have It.""

And I wanna commend the President, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, because she is tryin' to do somethin' needs to be done. I don't know if you know this but the United States Census Bureau says that by the year 2043, white Americans are gonna be a minority in this country. And for all the people out there who are in position of hiring, you better get smart because your workforce should reflect what this country looks like. And I'm gonna get real here. Everybody in here probably voted for Obama, but when I go to offices I ain't see no black folks except brother man at the security guard, who checks my name off the list as I go into the studio. So we could talk, you know, yabba-yabba-yabba, but we need to have some serious discussion about diversity and get some flava up in this. This industry is so behind sports it's ridiculous. It's easier to be the President of the United States as a black person than be the head of studio. Honest! It's easier to be the President of the United States than to be head of a studio, or head of a network. Let's leave Oprah out of it. She doesn't count. So, President, keep it going. I know it's tough, we've got a long way to go. Peace and love to people in France. And my last thing [holding up the statuette]... is Brooklyn in the house?! [Shouts and cheers from audience.] Brooklyn's in the house. Thank you very much.

2015,Honorary Award,None,"To Gena Rowlands, who has illuminated the human experience through her brilliant, passionate and fearless performances."," GENA ROWLANDS:
Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I do thank all of you. I thank you, Cate, and Laura, and Angie, and you, big boy.

NICK CASSAVETES:
You're welcome.

GENA ROWLANDS:
So, good evening. I want to thank the Academy's Board of Governors for this wonderful evening. I feel truly honored to be here. And, you know what's wonderful about being an actress is you don't just live one life – yours – you live many lives. And for that we have to thank the writers. After all, they're the ones who start out with a piece of blank paper and they create the story. And then they create the characters in the story, and that gives us actors the opportunity to, hopefully, bring all of those characters to life. And that's another wonderful thing about being an actress. You get to work with a lot of people, often other actors, that you have long admired. I was especially lucky because I got to work with Bette Davis, my all-time favorite.

We did a picture called ""Strangers,"" and I was thrilled to death when I heard that she was cast. And one day, we were finished with the day's work, and we went down to see the dailies, the film that we shot the day before. And we went to the screening room and they turned off the lights and they started the film. And I sat there like all actors do at the dailies, watching myself. Seeing if I did that too slowly, or if I didn't know, or it [wasn't] quite right, or if it was okay. And it did seem okay that day, so I was very happy.

And the lights went on and I started to gather my stuff to leave, and I looked over, and way in the far aisle was Bette and the cameraman. And they were too far away for me to hear what they were saying, but their body language was eloquent. Bette was... [Rowland points and gestures angrily]. And the cameraman was... [Rowlands smiles and makes placating gestures]. And since I was still, you know, I was so far away, I couldn't understand what they were saying, but I decided that this might be a good time for me to leave. And as I started for the door, Bette called out ""Gena!"" She said, ""Would you wait just a moment, please? I need to talk to you."" And I said, ""Sure."" And she walked over to me, her eyes were still just blazing. And she said, ""Did you see my lips?""

I thought she was kidding. So I said, ""No, did you lose them?"" And she said, ""That isn't funny. I mean my lips on the film that we just saw. They were bright orange! An unnatural orange! And [pointing] that's his fault, because he's the cameraman and he has the say-so about what colors are on the screen. So I think we ought to get rid of him, don't you?"" And I said, ""Well, Bette, to tell you the truth I wasn't paying strict attention, I wasn't noticing the details, you know, of the colors at all, and I just let my mind wander, I guess."" And she said, ""Oh really? You weren't concentrating? You let your mind wander? Well, let me tell you something. You better start concentrating and paying attention to detail because I'm telling you, you're no spring chicken yourself."" But she was so funny; we had a great time.

Well, I don't want to talk your heads off, but I would feel remiss if I didn't mention my late husband John Cassavetes. He wrote me the most magnificent parts – and for other actresses, too – and sometimes he directed them, and I surely do have to thank him for that. Oh, and I did want to thank the Board of Governors for introducing me to this fine fellow [puts her hand on the statuette]. Tall and shiny and gold; very handsome. You know, he's just so elegant that I'll – that is if nobody objects – I think I'll take him home with me tonight. And I'll find... [looks for her son Nick, who holds up the statuette to applause].

NICK CASSAVETES:
Blow 'em a kiss, Mom.

GENA ROWLANDS:
[Rowlands throws a kiss to the audience.]  And I'll find a wonderful place for him to sit. Maybe on the piano. And then everyone who comes to my house will have a chance to see him and admire him and love him the way I do. So thanks, Governors, and I'm very happy to see all of you here tonight in the audience. I'm happy to have been able to spend some time with you. Thank you.

Thank you so much to the Academy. To the women in this category – Natalie, Isabelle, Meryl, Ruth – you were all so extraordinary, and I look up to you and I admire you more than I can put into words. It has been the greatest honor just to stand alongside you; that is the greatest honor of all. To my mom and my dad and my brother Spencer and my soul sister Chrissy* and my whole family, I love you so much. Thank you for everything. And to Doug Wald, who stood by me all these years, and to Holly and Michelle and Craig and P.J. and Greta and Bob Cooper, thank you so much. And I realize that a moment like this is a huge confluence of luck and opportunity and so I want to thank Damien Chazelle for the opportunity to be part of a project that was so special and once in a lifetime. I'm so grateful to have been involved in this film. And thank you for your faith and your patience and such a wonderful experience. And Ryan Gosling, thank you for making me laugh and for always raising the bar and for being the greatest partner on this crazy adventure. To our whole crew, everyone that put their heart and souls into this film, I'm gonna find you all individually and I'm gonna thank you, along with my friends who I love so much, I am gonna hug the hell out of you when the feeling reenters my body. I still have a lot of growing and learning and work to do, and this guy is a really beautiful symbol to continue on that journey and I am so grateful for that. So thank you so much. Thank you.

2016,Actress in a Supporting Role,Fences,Viola Davis," VIOLA DAVIS:
Thank you to the Academy. You know, there's one place that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered. One place. And that's the graveyard. People ask me all the time, ""What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?"" And I say, exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories. The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition. People who fell in love and lost. I became an artist, and thank god I did, because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life. So here's to August Wilson, who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.

And to Bron Pictures, Paramount, MACRO, Todd Black, Molly Allen, Scott Rudin for being the cheerleaders for a movie that is about people, and words, and life, and forgiveness and grace. And to Mykelti Williamson, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Russell Hornsby, Jovan Adepo, Saniyya Sidney, for being the most wonderful artists I've ever worked with. And, ""O captain, my captain,"" Denzel Washington. Thank you for puttin' two entities in the driving seat: August and God. And they served you well.

And to Dan and Mae Alice Davis, who were the, and are the center of my universe. The people who taught me, good or bad, how to fail, how to love, how to hold an award, how to lose. My parents. I'm so thankful that God chose you to bring me into this world. To my sisters. My sister Deloris, who's here, who played Jaji and Jaja with me. We were rich white women in the tea party games. Thank you for the imagination. And to my husband and my daughter, my heart, you and Genesis. You teach me every day how to live, how to love. I'm so glad that you are the foundation of my life. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you.

I want to thank the Academy for acknowledging this untraditional film. I want to thank ESPN for allowing us the canvas and the time to tell this story; this is the only way it could be told. But I want to acknowledge that I wouldn't be standing here tonight if not for two people who aren't here with us: Ron Goldman, Nicole Brown, this is for them and their families. It is also for others, the victims of police violence, police brutality, racially-motivated violence and criminal injustice. This is their story as well as Ron and Nicole's.

ORLANDO VON EINSIEDEL:
Sadly, Raed Saleh, the head of the White Helmets, is not able to join us tonight. We have a very short statement from him that we'd like to share with you: We're so grateful that this film has highlighted our work to the world. Our organization is guided by a verse from the Koran: ""To save one life is to save all of humanity."" We have saved more than 82,000 Syrian lives. I invite anyone here who hears me to work on the side of life, to stop the bloodshed in Syria and around the world.

It's very easy for these guys to feel they're forgotten. This war's been going on for six years. If everyone could just stand up and remind them that we all care that this war end as quickly as possible. Thank you.

[0:37] Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you to Lionsgate. Thank you to our incredible cast and crew who are all up here right now. Thank you to Jamie Feldman, to Gary Gilbert. Thank you to my parents for supporting my choice to pursue a career in the arts even though it was a little bit crazy. Arthur Horowitz, you are my fantasy baby. And to my kind, generous, talented, beautiful, blue-eyed wife and creative partner, Julia Hart, you have inspired me to become the man I am right now, and more importantly the man I'm still becoming. There's a lot of love in this room, and let's use it to create and champion bold and diverse work, work that inspires us towards joy, towards hope, and towards empathy.

MARC PLATT (Best Picture nominee, ""La La Land""):
[1:32] Here's to the fools who made me dream: my uncle Gary Platt; my mentor Sam Cohn; my parents; my children; my wife, Julie, on whose shoulders I've stood for 40 years, because she insisted I reach for the stars. And to the Hollywood community that I'm so proud to be a part of, and to the Hollywood in the hearts and minds of people everywhere, [behind Platt, a production crew member is showing the other two producers the correct winner card] repression is the enemy of civilization. So keep dreaming, because the dreams we dream today will provide the love, the compassion and the humanity that will narrate the stories of our lives tomorrow. Fred?

Thank you to the Acad—I don't know what to say. That was really... I'm not sure, I'm still not sure this is real. But thank you to the Academy. It is so humbling to be standing up here with hopefully still the ""La La"" crew? No, okay, they're gone. But it's very humbling to be up here. And I think, I hope even more than that, that it's inspiring to people, little black boys and brown girls and other folks watching at home, who feel marginalized and who take some inspiration from seeing this beautiful group of artists, helmed by this amazing talent, my friend Barry Jenkins, standing up here on this stage accepting this top honor. Thank you.

BARRY JENKINS:
There was a time when I thought this movie was impossible because I couldn't bring it to fruition, I couldn't bring myself to tell another story. And so everybody behind me on this stage said, no, that is not acceptable. So I just want to thank everybody up here behind me. Everybody out there in that room – because we didn't do this, you guys chose us. Thank you for the choice. I appreciate it. Much love.

JEREMY KLEINER:
Good night. Thank you so much.

JIMMY KIMMEL:
Well, I don't know what happened. I blame myself for this. Let's remember, it's just an awards show. I mean, we hate to see people disappointed but the good news is we got to see some extra speeches.

Academy Award! I still can't believe I'm standing here. It's a dream. Long time ago, every year when I watch Oscar with my dad, sometime with my mom. My dad always say, ""Son, you get so many movie award in the world. When are you get one of these?"" Then I just look at my dad: ""Ha, ha, ha. Dad, I only make comedy action movies."" Many years later I come to Hollywood, meeting with some big studio, director, my friend's house, Stallone's house. That was 23 years ago. I see these little things in his house. I touched it. I kissed it. I smelled it. I believe still have my fingerprints in; you keep it. Then I talk to myself, ""I really want one."" Finally, Cheryl calls. I said, ""Are you sure?""

2016,Honorary Award,None,"To Anne V. Coates, in recognition of a film editing career of remarkable breadth and exceptional collaborative achievement."," ANNE V. COATES:
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Academy Governors, for giving me this award. I feel very honored and excited, until I realized I had to make a speech. There was a reason I stayed behind the camera. Seriously though, I feel so lucky to have had this wonderful life doing a job I love, working with some of the finest directors of the last 50 years on some of the most fascinating scripts ever written. And to top it off, travel around the globe to some of the planet's most incredible and mesmerizing locations. And can you imagine a job where you are actually paid to look into the eyes of George Clooney, Peter O'Toole, Richard Burton, Peter Finch, Sean Connery, Albert Finney, Clint Eastwood, Richard Gere, Daniel Craig, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and those of ""50 Shades of Grey"" himself, Jamie Dornan?

My life has been so varied that I always say, I work with directors ranging from David Lean to David Lynch, Sir Carroll Reed to Steven Soderbergh, and Sidney Lumet to Wolfgang Peterson, and many other talented ones in between. Too many to mention; too many to upset that I didn't mention them, because you know how directors are. But I would like to thank them all for the good times, the manic and creative times, and even those times they keep me in the cutting room until the wee hours seven days a week. I might mumble something incoherent at the time, but looking back I wouldn't change a thing.

But of all those, I still have to say my greatest production are my three wonderful and talented children, without whose love and support I would not be up here today. My two sons, Anthony and James Hickox, are both writer/directors. My eldest, Anthony, has made over 30 feature films, and my youngest, James, isn't far behind him, having just spent six weeks in Greece shooting – lucky him. And of course, in the middle of these two is my daughter Emma, who swore she would never follow in my footsteps but somehow ended up a fabulous editor and is now taking my jobs. Between them they have gifted me four grandchildren. The eldest, my lovely Olivia. And then the gorgeous – Emma's two gorgeous, Mathilda and Alexander. And the newest arrival, Florence. I like to call them my own little dynasty.

So thank you once more for this very special award. I have to say I never suspected I would be holding one of these in my hand again. I like to think that I can share this with all the editors, the unsung heroes out there, most of them probably still working frantically as I speak, as this type of special award reminds us that we do not do so entirely unnoticed. Good night, and may whichever God you believe in bless you.

2016,Honorary Award,None,"To Frederick Wiseman, whose masterful and distinctive documentaries examine the familiar and reveal the unexpected."," FREDERICK WISEMAN:
Thank you. Thank you. I'm very pleased to be here to receive the Board of Governors Honorary Academy Award. It's a great and wonderful recognition of the work I've been doing for 50 years. What's kept me going is that it's fun and an adventure. Constantly working also keeps me off the street, or at least on the streets that I like. While making the movies is physically and intellectually demanding it's rare that I felt any strain. I'm lucky I found work that I like and that I continue to be obsessed with. This compulsion has always been understood by my wife, Zipporah, and my sons, David and Eric. I am grateful and very appreciative for their constant support. They recognized long ago that I'm a New England Jewish Puritan and let me go my errant ways. I'm also very pleased that my grandchildren, Tess and Ben and Charlie, are here tonight to help me celebrate.

I want to thank Karen Konicek, who has run my production company, Zipporah Films, for 35 years, and whose unfailing good cheer and sound advice has made it possible to wander around and make movies. I also want to express my thanks and appreciation to John Davey, the terrific cameraman with whom I worked since 1979. I'm glad that both John and Karen are here tonight. I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the late William Brayne, the cameraman who worked with me on many earlier films. And also I want to thank the many others who helped in the production of the movies. Irwin Young, the President of DuArt Films, one of independent filmmaker's best friends, provided deferment deals which made many of my early films possible. I'm grateful to PBS for its support for all of my films. The films couldn't have made without – couldn't have not have been made without the constant support of The Ford Foundation and frequent grants from the MacArthur, Pershing Square, and LEF Foundations, ITVS and the Sundance Documentary Fund. Additional funding has sometimes been provided by my singing and selling pencils outside Neiman Marcus department stores.

Making a movie is always an adventure. I usually know nothing about the subject before I start, and I know there are those that feel I know nothing about it when it's finished. I never start with a point of view about the subject or a thesis that I want to prove. I also don't do any research in advance of the shooting. I usually don't know in advance what's going to be shot or what I'm gonna stumble across in any day or any moment of any day. The editing is an effort to impose order on the chaos of the rushes through the creation of a fictional form that provides meaning to the film. The goal is to make a film that is close to a, closer to a visual novel than a journalistic account. This process involves sitting in the editing room for eight to ten months, getting fed intravenously until the film is found.

Each film is also an opportunity to learn something about a new subject. I've been involved in a 50-year course in adult education, where I'm the alleged adult who studies a new subject every year. The variety and complexity of the human behavior observed in making one of the films, and cumulatively all of the films, is staggering. And I think it is as important to document kindness, civility and generosity of spirit as it is to show cruelty, banality and indifference. There are always a lot of laughs and I'm not the first to observe that so much of human behavior, my own and others, is when seen from a detached point of view, funny. For example, when I was working on the film that became ""Near Death,"" a film about dying patients, there were several occasions when we shot in the hospital morgue. On the last day of shooting I went around thanking the various staff who had been helpful. Among them was a man responsible for the morgue. I caught up with him in the hospital cafeteria and thanked him for his help. We shook hands warmly and he said, ""See you soon."" Thank you, and see you soon.

I love you, Dot. And I especially want to thank my clan, Joel and Pedro ""McCoen."" These two stalwart individuals were well-raised by their feminist mothers. They value themselves, each other, and those around them. I know you are proud of me and that fills me with everlasting joy.

And now, I want to get some perspective. If I may be so honored to have all the female nominees in every category stand with me in this room tonight. The actors—Meryl, if you do it everybody else will, c'mon. The filmmakers. The producers. The directors. The writers. The cinematographer. The composers. The songwriters. The designers. C'mon! Okay. Look around, everybody. Look around, ladies and gentlemen, because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed. Don't talk to us about it at the parties tonight. Invite us into your office in a couple days—or you can come to ours, whichever suits you best—and we'll tell you all about them.

Our movie is about a deaf child being born into a world of silence. It's not exaggerated or sensationalized for the movie; this is happening. Millions of children all over the world live in silence and face communication barriers, and particularly access to education. So, deafness is a silent disability.

David Livingstone, Cameron McCracken, director Rupert Goold, boy, it was a privilege to work with you and I feel so proud to be in your beautiful movie. I gotta thank my stage moms: Matt, Anna, Geoff and Eric Vetro, Paul, Gary. Jessie Buckley, Finn Wittrock, Rufus Sewell, all the cast and the crew who worked so hard on this film to celebrate Judy Garland. My extended family at CAA: Peter, Bryan and Kevin. Imprint: Nicole and Dom. Nanci Ryder, thank you for the 25 years. John Carrabino, my handsome date of 25 years, thank you for always dreaming bigger than I would dare and for bringin' it back to the work and joy and gratitude.

Big brother Drew, Brandy, Judy, Stone and Ava, for all the love, all the love and support possible that makes you believe anything is possible.

And I have to say that this past year of conversations celebrating Judy Garland across genders and – I'm sorry – across generations and across cultures has been a really cool reminder that our heroes unite us. You know, the best among us who inspire us to find the best in ourselves. You know, when they unite us, when we look to our heroes, we agree. And that matters. Neil Armstrong, Sally Ride, Delores Huerta, Venus and Serena, and Selena, Bob Dylan, Scorsese, Fred Rogers, Harriet Tubman. We agree on our teachers and we agree on our courageous men and women in uniform who serve. We agree on our first responders and firefighters. And when we celebrate our heroes we're reminded of who we are as one people, united. And though Judy Garland did not receive this honor in her time, I am certain that this moment is an extension of the celebration of her legacy that began on our film set. And is also representative of the fact that her legacy of unique exceptionalism and inclusivity and generosity of spirit, it transcends any one artistic achievement. Miss Garland, you were certainly among the heroes who unite and define us, and this is certainly for you. I am so grateful. Thank you so much, everybody. Good night.",,Renée Zellweger

And I'd like to thank everybody who's been supporting ""Parasite,"" and who's been working with ""Parasite,"" and who's been loving ""Parasite."" And I'd like to thank my brother who's been always supporting our building our dreams, even when it looked impossible dream. Thank you, Jay. I want to thank my brother Jay. And especially, I really, really, really want to thank our Korean film audience, our moviegoers, who's been really supporting all our movies and never hesitated to give us straightforward opinion on what they feel like their movies. And that made us really never be able to be complacent and keep pushing the directors, the creators, keep pushing the envelopes. And without you, our Korean film audience, we are not here. Thank you very much. Thank you.",,Kwak Sin-ae

Thank you to the Academy. And thank you and we share this with our incredible art department and my partner in crime, decorator Nancy Haigh. And mostly to Quentin Tarantino, for writing an epic masterpiece and letting us take this wild ride with him. Thank you.

2019,Short Film (Animated),Hair Love,Matthew A. Cherry and Karen Rupert Toliver,"KAREN RUPERT TOLIVER:
Thank you so much to the Academy and everybody out there that supported this film. There were lots of you. We share this award with you. There were so many filmmakers that worked so hard on this, and it was a labor of love. And it was because we have a firm belief that representation matters deeply, especially in cartoons. Because in cartoons that's when we first see our movies, and it's how we shape our lives and think about how we see the world. So I want to thank Sony Pictures Animation, who were the progressive people that believed in us from the beginning: Kristine Belson, Jeff Korchek. Thank you to Lion Forge Animation, to Six Point Harness and to Matthew Cherry. Thank you to my beautiful husband, my son[s] Chase and Miles, for believing in me. Thank you so much.

MATTHEW A. CHERRY:
So we have a big team that we have to thank but time is running short, so I just want to say that ""Hair Love"" was done because we wanted to see more representation in animation. We wanted to normalize black hair. There's a very important issue that's out there; it's the Crown Act. And if we can help to get this passed in all 50 states it will help stories like DeAndre Arnold's, who's our special guest tonight, stop to happen. This award is dedicated to Kobe Bryant. May we all have a second act as great as his was. Thank you.",,Karen Rupert Toliver

Mr. Brad Pitt, finally, nice to meet you. Where were you while we were filming in Tulsa? Is very honor to meet you. As you know, I'm from Korea and actually my name is Yuh-Jung Youn and most of European people call me [pronounced] Yuh-Yung and some of them call me [pronounced] Yoo-Jung. But tonight, you are all forgiven. And well, I would usually when I'm living in the other part of the world, I just watch the television. It is the Oscar, but, event on the television, just watching, like a television program for us. But me being here by myself, this I cannot believe. I'm here. Okay, let me pull myself together.

Thank you for the tremendous thanks to the Academy members who vote for me. And next [in the] speech, okay, they usually say, okay, thank you for the [laughs]... wonderful ""Minari"" family. Steven, Isaac, Yeri, and Noel, Alan. We became a family. And most of all, above all, Lee Isaac Chung. Without him I couldn't be here tonight. He was our captain and my director. So thanks to you. Tremendous thanks to you.

And I like to thank to – well, see, I don't believing in competition. How can I win Glenn Close, win over Glenn Close? I've been watching her so many performances. So, this is just, all the nominee, five nominees, we are the winner for the different movie, different role. We played the different role. So we cannot compete each other. Tonight I'm here. It's just I have just little bit luck, I think, maybe. I'm luckier than you. And also, maybe, is American hospitality for the Korean actor? I'm not sure. But anyway, thank you so much. And I like to thank to my two boys, who made me go out and work. Beloved sons, Eol and Nuel, this is the result [holds up the Oscar] because Mommy work so hard. And I like to dedicate this award for my first director, Kim Ki-young, who was very genius director. I made the movie together with him, first movie. I think he would be very happy if he's still alive. Thank you very much. Tremendous thank you for the everybody. Thank you.

2020,Animated Feature Film,Soul,Pete Docter and Dana Murray,"PETE DOCTER:
Wow, okay, I've been nominated to speak on behalf of Dana and Kemp Powers, our co-director. This film started as a love letter to jazz, but we had no idea how much jazz would teach us about life. Like we don't get to control what happens but we can, like a jazz musician, turn whatever happens into something of value and something of beauty. And that was certainly true of our amazing cast. Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, you guys are amazing. Our brilliant collaborators, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, Jon Batiste, this guy over there [pointing to Questlove], it was just fantastic working with all you guys. Our cultural consultants, Dr. Johnnetta Cole, people who kept us honest and keep those characters truthful. We're really thankful to our partners at Disney who, when we said: Hey, we want to do a film that explores the purpose of life. They're like: Okay, go ahead. That's not your usual cartoon fare. And of course, to our family. Dana wants to thank…

DANA MURRAY:
My amazing husband, my parents, I'm here because of you. I love you so much. Hazel and Murray, my babies at home, you're everything to me. We obviously have to think of the crew who made this film and even finished it from home with seven weeks of production left. You are, you should be up here with us, and we are just the lucky speakers. I'm not supposed to be speaking actually.

PETE DOCTER:
So our main character, Joe, is a music teacher. We want to thank music teachers and art teachers everywhere. You – including my parents Dave and Rita and Dana's parents Pam and Tom – you make the world a better place. And my wish for all of us tonight is that we could follow the example of jazz musicians, that, wherever we are, whatever we have, we turn it into something beautiful. Thank you.",,Dana Murray

Thank you to the Academy. And thank you to all of our incredible nominees who spent so many years and, I presume, a lot of tears making beautiful and important films and bringing them into the world. I'd like to thank Craig Foster and his family, especially Tom and Swati, who opened their hearts and supported us every step of the way, and fed us and allowed their home to become a production company for three years. I want to thank our production partners at Off the Fence, especially Ellen Windemuth and Sam Barton-Humphreys, who believed in this film before it was anything. We want to thank Netflix for enabling us to share our story with the world. And then our incredible ""Octopus"" team, whose arms stretch across the planet from South Africa to Amsterdam to the U.K. to the U.S. Roger and Warren, for beautiful cinematography. Dan and Jinx, for incredible patience and editing. Kevin and Barry and Kyle and all the people at the Refinery. And the incredible Sea Change Project, who's been in the background supporting us the whole way along and caring so much for the Great African Seaforest, which is where the octopus lived. And our friends and family, who put up with years and years of tunnel vision. In many – and I know there are many South Africans who are awake in the middle of the night to watch this ceremony. And in many ways this really is a tiny, personal story that played out in a sea forest at the very tip of Africa. But on a more universal level, I hope that it provided a glimpse of a different kind of relationship between human beings and the natural world.

JAMES REED:
And I don't have a lot to add to that. Pippa covered it very well. And it's a great and totally overwhelming honor to be here and so thank you so much to the Academy. And all the incredible films that were in our category, it's really humbling and amazing. And I'd also like to thank my family: Rosie and Isabel*, and my mum and my two sisters, Jenny* and Janice. I don't think I'd be here today without their sort of level of love and support, so thank you very much. And I think the final extra thank you for Craig, who, while it was such an enormous team making this film in the end, it sort of began and ended with him and it's his story. And he kind of showed us that, you know, if a man can kind of form a friendship with an octopus it does sort of make you wonder what else is possible. So thank you, Craig. And cheers, everyone.",,Pippa Ehrlich
2020,Documentary (Short Subject),Colette,Anthony Giacchino and Alice Doyard,"ANTHONY GIACCHINO:
Thank you to the Academy. I hope the actors in the room don't mind that I have something written down here because there're all different kinds of people in the Academy. Today's Colette's birthday. She was born just 22 days before the very first Oscars in 1929. So I imagine it must have been a, probably about a crowd about this big, right? You know? When she, when we got nominated she told us that, or she reminded us, that the power of documentary filmmaking ensured that her brother Jean-Pierre was, as she put it, no longer lost in the night and fog of the Nazi concentration camp system. And I want to say that I think it's that same power of the documentary storytelling that is going to ensure that the memory, courage and resilience of Latasha Harlins, Horace Bowers, the innocent children of Yemen and the protesters in Hong Kong are not forgotten. I mean, that's why we do this. That's why we make these films, so thank you. Thank you. We're grateful that these stories and these individuals have been honored tonight. And I also would just like to thank, of course, Colette et Lucie. I want to thank our amazing EP Peter Hirschmann at Electronic Arts. Everyone at Electronic Arts and Respawn and Oculus, especially Vince, Dusty and Laura. And our producers Annie Small and Aaron Matthews, thank you so much. To the Guardians, Charlie Phillips, Jess Gormley and Lindsay Poulton, we share this award with you.

And I just add something. This award is a tribute and this film is a tribute to woman everywhere in the world, of any ages, who are joining hands and fight for justice. Vive Colette et vive la France.",,Alice Doyard

I was raised by my grandfather, James Holland. He was an original Tuskegee Airman. He represented the U.S. in the first Pan Am Games. He went to Argentina. He met Evita. He graduated from Northwestern University at a time that they did not allow Blacks to stay on campus, so he stayed at the YMCA. And after all of his accomplishments, he went back to his hometown in hopes of becoming a teacher. But they did not hire Blacks in the school system. So I want to say thank you to our ancestors who put the work in, were denied, but never gave up. And I also stand here, as Jamika and I break this glass ceiling with so much excitement for the future. Because I can picture Black trans women standing up here. And Asian sisters. And our Latina sisters. And Indigenous women. And I know that one day it won't be unusual or groundbreaking, it will just be normal.

Of course I have to thank God for giving us these gifts, and my parents, my beautiful mother who's here with me today and my father at home. All those days of listening to Sly and the Family Stone and Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye, they really paid off. So thank you, Dad. Thank you so much to Archie and Shaka King and everybody that was involved in this movie and gave me the call and gave us the call to do this record. I'm so, so grateful.

I just want to say this. You know, musicians, filmmakers, I believe we have an opportunity and a responsibility, to me, to tell the truth and to write history the way that it was and how it connects us to today and what we see going on in the world today. And yeah, I'm just, I have no words. I'm just so, so, so happy and grateful. And yeah, knowledge is power. Music is power. And as long as I'm standing I'm always gonna fight for us. I'm always gonna fight for my people and fight for what's right, and I think that's what music does and that's what storytelling does. So thank you so much. Thank you.",,H.E.R. & Tiara Thomas

And you know, when I was young, I never realized that this was a career that was even a possibility.

So, thank you so much for the Academy for recognizing this wonderful film. I'm sorry, my English is not very good so that I'm going to read a bit because I don't want to make problems.

So now I would like to say something more personal. Fellini once said, in the history of cinema, beyond the evolution of styles and techniques, what stays embodied in films is their human vitality. And whoever enjoys it receives a charge of energy, something pulsing, mysterious and vibrant. ""Sound of Metal,"" I received from its team so much care, love and attention, so much energy, that we believe it's one of the reasons why the film has been received by the audience so beautifully. So thank you for that. Thank you very much.",,Michelle Couttolenc

Oh my gosh. They said write a speech and I didn't 'cause I just didn't think this would ever happen. And I'm going to be in trouble with Steven Soderbergh. I'm so sorry. I don't want him to be cross with me. Oh my god, he's so heavy [referring to the Oscar statuette], and he's so cold! I better lay him down. So the only speech I ever wrote was when I was ten. And I had a look to see if there'd be anything useful from it, but unfortunately it mostly thanked Zack Morris from ""Saved by the Bell,"" who was my very supportive husband. Unfortunately, he hasn't been as much a part of my life as I'd hoped, and so that speech is not that useful.

But all I can say is – I'm trying very hard not to cry, which is very difficult as an English person because you don't cry ever. This film was made by the most incredible people in the world, who made it in 23 days, just, and brought their complete genius and love and humor to it. And I have so many people to thank. I feel mortified that I'm here by myself when it's not just my job at all. I want to thank Carey Mulligan for being not only the most talented person in the world, but the kindest and the funniest. I want to thank the producers for standing behind this film always and, you know, never giving up. And LuckyChap, Focus, FilmNation. The cast and the crew, the greatest in the world, the kindest in the world. They just made me look good, and again, I'm just so grateful. Finally, my family: Mum, Dad, Coco, my husband Chris – come on, come on – our son, who did not arrive until a couple of weeks after shooting. Thank god, because I was crossing my legs the whole way through. So thank you all so much. Steven, I hope that was alright. Thank you.",,Emerald Fennell

I definitely would not be up here right now, I probably wouldn't even have a career, if it wasn't for Hylda Queally, Paul Nelson, Steve Warren and Nicole Perna. I love you guys; thank you very much. I just have to say your guys's names because I love you. Kristen, Nicole, Penélope, Olivia, I love guys so much, and to be included in the conversation with you is such an honor. I have to thank Michael Showalter, my director, who created a space that inspired creativity and love and courage.

I have to thank David Greenbaum, Matthew Greenfield, all of Searchlight, for shepherding our film. My scene partner and collaborator, Andrew Garfield -- the brilliant Andrew Garfield. Thank you so much for bringing out the best in me by showing up every day with the best of you. Thank you.

And right now we are coming out of some difficult times that have been filled with a lot of trauma and isolation. And so many people out there feel hopelessness and they feel alone. And suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States. It's touched many families; it's touched mine. And especially members of the LGBTQ community, who oftentimes feel out of place with their peers. There is -- we're faced with discriminatory and bigoted legislation that is sweeping our country with the only goal of further dividing us. There's violence and hate crimes being perpetuated on innocent civilians all over the world. And in times like this I think of Tammy, and I'm inspired by her radical acts of love. We've talked about love a lot tonight. And I'm inspired by her compassion and I see it as a guiding principle that leads us forward. And it connects us all in the desire that we want to be accepted for who we are, accepted for who we love, and to live a life without the fear of violence or terror. And for any of you out there who do in fact feel hopeless or alone, I just want you to know that you are unconditionally loved for the uniqueness that is you. Mio tesoro, Giulietta, Augustus.

If I took the time to say thank you to every single beautiful person who has lifted me up on this stage you'd find people would be sitting here until next Oscars, so I'm not going to do that. But just allow me to say that it was the summer of a lifetime and I am the most privileged and grateful to have spent it with all of you.

2021,Costume Design,Cruella,Jenny Beavan,"JENNY BEAVAN:
[Holding up the Oscar:] Team ""Cruella."" Go team ""Cruella."" Now if you heard the really embarrassing noises it was probably my family who are somewhere up there, who supported me through this extraordinary experience. Which had massive amounts of fun, as you can see, but also, it was slightly stressful. The only one I'm missing is my darling son-in-law David, who used to give me good advice at the end of every day but is no longer with us. Anyway, [looking down at her outfit] I just thought I should explain -- it obviously didn't go down well last time. This is honoring my inner Cruella: a little bit of Maddy Moxham, Random Lapel, Tom Davies eyewear, Thom Botwood graffiti.

And I have to tell you when Kristin Burr and Craig Gillespie asked me to do this movie, I truly didn't think we had the time. I mean, I actually nearly said no. Glad I didn't. The only reason I didn't was because Clare Spragge -- who's sitting just there, sparkling -- said she would come on board as costume supervisor and bring the team. The team of the most phenomenal, creative, clever, generous, amazing people, I mean, without whom obviously it wouldn't have happened. And I also need to thank Nadia and Naomi and Julia, our makeup and hair team, because they complete the looks. I mean, you know, it would be a little sad putting a Cruella costume in my hair. But also, the actors who just brought such life. I think Emma Thompson hyperventilating over some of her fittings with joy was one of the highlights of my career.

Anyway, I think that's all. [Paging through her show program:] I kind of, of course left the thing in the car and had to write it all on here. But I think I've probably -- people have made such wonderful speeches. But the lovely thing I think about a film like ""Cruella"" is it does bring a bit of fun and joy in these terrible times, which others have mentioned. [Music begins to play.] But, you know, it -- it was great to do. And thank you, Academy. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",,Jenny Beavan

We'd like to thank our North Carolina teams. Fractured FX, their entire team who did all of the effects makeup through Justin. And I also want to say that there are tens of thousands of crafts people just like us, who are below the line, who come into work every day and work long and hard and who never get the opportunity to have this kind of recognition.

Thank you. Thank you. For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, this is a beacon of hope and possibilities. This is proof that dreams dream big, and dreams do come true. And, ladies, don't let anybody tell you you are ever past your prime. Never give up.

But I have to dedicate this to my mom, all the moms in the world, because they are really the superheroes, and without them none of us will be here tonight. She's 84 and I'm taking this home to her.

Wow. Nice. Nice to see you again. Thank you to the Academy for recognizing the superhero that is a Black woman. She endures. She loves. She overcomes. She is every woman in this film.

Thank you to the Academy. We are humbled to be in the company of such an extraordinary crop of documentary filmmakers. These films redefine what it is to be, make a documentary. To everyone who helped make our film, you know who you are, your bravery and courage made this film possible. We owe so much to our Bulgarian nerd with the laptop, Christo Grozev. Christo, you risked everything to tell this story, and it's investigative journalists like you and Maria Pevchikh that empower our work. To the Navalny family, Yulia, Dasha and Zakhar, thank you for your courage. The world is with you. And there's one person who couldn't be with us here tonight. Alexei Navalny, the leader of the Russian opposition, remains in solitary confinement for what he calls -- I want to make sure we get his words exactly right: ""Vladimir Putin's unjust war of aggression in Ukraine."" I would like to dedicate this award to Navalny, to all political prisoners around the world. Alexei, the world has not forgotten your vital message to us all. We cannot, we must not be afraid to oppose dictators and authoritarianism wherever it rears its head. I want to invite Yulia to say a few quick remarks. Yulia.

YULIA NAVALNAYA:
Thank you, Daniel. And thank you to everybody here. My husband is in prison just for telling the truth. My husband is in prison just for defending democracy. Alexei, I am dreaming of the day when you will be free and our country will be free. Stay strong, my love. Thank you.",,"Odessa Rae

Thank you so much, dear Academy. I am completely blown away. I would like to thank first of all our beautiful director Edward Berger, without you I could have not done it.

2022,Writing (Adapted Screenplay),WOMEN TALKING,Sarah Polley,"SARAH POLLEY:
Thank you. First of all, I just want to thank the Academy for not being mortally offended by the words ""women"" and ""talking"" put so close together like that. Cheers. Miriam Toews wrote an essential novel about a radical act of democracy in which people who don't agree on every single issue manage to sit together in a room and carve out a way forward together, free of violence. They do so not just by talking but also by listening. The last line of our film is delivered by a young woman to a new baby, and she says: ""Your story will be different from ours."" It's a promise, a commitment, and an anchor. And it's what I would like to say with all of my might to my three incredible kids, Eve, Isla, and Amy, as they make their way through this complicated, beautiful world. Thank you to the best man I've ever known, David Sandomierski, for giving me the optimism to believe we can and will do better. Dede Gardner and Frances McDormand, thank you for letting me stand on your shoulders and making this space for me. We have the most incredible cast and the most incredible crew, some of whom are here tonight -- please, stand up if you're there [pointing] or in the nosebleeds, and everybody at home who worked on this film. Oh my god! I accept this on all of our behalf. Thank you. Thank you. Wow!",,Sarah Polley
