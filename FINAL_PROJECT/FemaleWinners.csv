1939,Actress,Gone with the Wind,Vivien Leigh," VIVIEN LEIGH:
Ladies and gentlemen, please forgive me if my words are inadequate in thanking you for your very great kindness.  If I were to mention all those who have shown me such wonderful generosity through ""Gone with the  Wind"" I should have to entertain you with an oration as long as ""Gone with the  Wind"" itself. So if I may, I should like to devote my thanks on this occasion to that composite figure of energy, courage, and very great kindness, in whom all points of ""Gone with the  Wind"" meet -- Mr. David Selznick.

1939,Actress in a Supporting Role,Gone with the Wind,Hattie McDaniel," HATTIE McDANIEL:
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science[s], fellow members of the motion picture industry and honored guests.  This is one of the happiest moments of my life, and I want to thank each one of you who had a part in selecting me for one of the awards for your kindness.  It has made me feel very, very humble and I shall always hold it as a beacon for anything I may be able to do in the future.  I sincerely hope I shall always be a credit to my race and to the motion picture industry.  My heart is too full to tell you just how I feel.  And may I say thank you and God bless you.

1941,Actress,Suspicion,Joan Fontaine," JOAN FONTAINE:
I want to thank the ladies and gentlemen that voted me this award. And I want to say thank you, David Selznick. And if Alfred Hitchcock were here tonight I'd like to say to him, thank you, Hitch, with all my heart.

1941,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Great Lie,Mary Astor," MARY ASTOR:
Ladies and gentlemen, twenty-two years ago this coming June I first faced a motion picture camera – I hasten to add I was very young. I'm going to let you write the rest of the script and just say thank you very, very much.

1942,Actress,Mrs. Miniver,Greer Garson," [The Academy has newsreel coverage of only portions of Garson's acceptance speech.  While it is clear that the opening paragraph is the beginning of her speech, it is not known how the rest of the pieces fit together or the extent of the missing footage.]

GREER GARSON:
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished visitors from the armed forces, Governor Warren, honored guests, Mr. Chairman – Mr. President Chairman:  Thank you. That is really all there is to say; but, as this is after all the opportunity of a lifetime, I hope you won't mind if I try to expand that word just, just a little.  This is, this is going to be a great evening to remember. We've had some very exciting messages and some very exciting speeches. It should make us all very proud to belong to this great and fascinating industry. Praise from our government and our armed forces and from abroad from our allies for work we have done should make us determined to carry on. We have somehow brought very wide horizons into this room tonight. Anything that I have to say now, which is practically unprepared... [camera cuts]

As for the nominations, I've always felt that to be nominated simply means that you've had the great good luck to be entrusted with one of the best assignments of the current year, and that's a cause for rejoicing in itself. And there isn't a single good craftsman in this industry who if given such an opportunity can't be counted on to measure up to it.  Why do we all long to win the award? It's no question of superiority because we're comparing different excellences and they're varied in their nature and they can't be fairly compared. There's no rivalry in this room tonight. There's no competition.  As the Dodo said to Alice in Wonderland: ""Everybody has won and everybody shall have a prize."" The nominations are really the prizes.  The award...I, I can hardly believe that it's really for me tonight.  It's always seemed to me something very personal, a gesture from the men and women of this industry who choose to show not only recognition of, of work... [camera cuts]

Ladies and gentlemen, I came to this country as a stranger five years ago. I've been very happy and very proud to be a member of this community and of this industry all that time. And from everybody I met or worked with truly I have received such ready kindness that for quite a long while I couldn't believe that it was true, but tonight you have made me feel that you have really set the door of your friendship wide open and that welcome is officially on the mat, and that is why I'm so happy.  [camera cuts]

...very humbly, very gratefully I say thank you and I step across your threshold. There... [camera cuts]

...if I may say so, the girl who's always on the sidelines, my quite specially wonderful little mother. And after her, Sidney Franklin the great, the inimitable Willy Wyler... [camera cuts]
"
1942,Actress in a Supporting Role,Mrs. Miniver,Teresa Wright," TERESA WRIGHT:
Thank you.  I wish Major Wyler were here tonight so I could thank him first for his splendid direction.  And I'd like to thank Mr. Mayer and Mr. Franklin for giving me the part.  And I'd like to thank the people who gave me this because they're the people I work with and therefore it's doubly thrilling to get it from them.  Thank you.
"
1943,Actress in a Supporting Role,For Whom the Bell Tolls,Katina Paxinou," KATINA PAXINOU:
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to share this great honor with, which is bestowed on me tonight, with my colleagues of the Royal Theatre of Athens whom, whether they are now dead or alive, fate has ordained me to represent here. I am deeply moved and I wish to thank Paramount, who offered me the chance to play ""Pilar,"" Mr. Buddy DeSylva, my director Sam Wood, and all those who, who are responsible for this happy moment. I would like to thank also the voters and the committee of the Academy Award for giving me, besides this honor, the opportunity to send through the air my, my deep love and admiration to the heroic boys, to the heroic soldiers of your great nation, the American boys who are fighting with their allies all over the world for liberty, justice and human dignity. Thank you again.
"
1946,Actress,To Each His Own,Olivia de Havilland," OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND:
Since I value highly the profession which has instructed me, rewarded me, and permitted me my share of the world's work, it will understand and forgive me, I know, for the very great pride I feel in receiving this symbol of its approbation, one of the Awards of Merit, for my part in this past year, what has been done.  But even in this wonderful moment my common sense reminds me quite clearly that most of the work that went into earning this award was not done by Olivia de Havilland at all, but by a big team of other people who, if justice were really to prevail, would be standing up here beside me now.  When I think of the writer who created ""Jody Norris,"" and how much of her sprang from the heart and mind of the director. When I remember the businessmen who found and managed the money which produced her and distributed her.  And how she grew under the talents and skills of the technicians: the cameraman, the makeup man, the hairdresser, the costumer. And then I think how much the musicians did for her. Then I feel humble too, as well as proud, to accept this award which I do in the name of my team as well as my own.  Thank you.
"
1946,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Razor's Edge,Anne Baxter," ANNE BAXTER:
I want to thank all the Academy members for this very great honor.  And I'd like to present my appreciation to Mr. Zanuck for the opportunity to play ""Sophie.""  And above all, my deepest thanks to Mr. Eddie Goulding, without whose fine direction and understanding ""Sophie"" never would have been.  I'm deeply grateful.  Thank you again.
"
1947,Actress,The Farmer's Daughter,Loretta Young," LORETTA YOUNG:
[Taps three times on the microphone.]  That's my heart.  You know, up until now, presentations of the Academy Awards has been a purely spectator sport for me.  However, tonight I, uh, dressed for the stage just in case.

But in all honesty, I suppose I couldn't expect to be more elated than I was when I heard I was nominated, because I had seen and I knew the beautiful jobs done by the other four nominees:  Rosalind's vitality and her great technical skill in bringing that classic character to life; Joan's expert craftsmanship in ""Possessed""; and the magic and delicacy that Dorothy McGuire brings to any role, and particularly in this one; and the superb artistry of Susan Hayward who succeeded in turning a very difficult characterization into an authentic character and a personal triumph.  Yes, yes, I think my great thrill was when ""Katie"" was voted into that class.  Course, we all know there wouldn't have been any ""Katie"" if it hadn't have been beautifully written and directed and photographed and... and magnificently produced by Mr. Dore Schary.  For my part, I am thankful to have been in a picture that made so many people think fondly and possessively of their country, and of our industry that can give them those thoughts.

And as for you [looking at Oscar], at long last!  Good night and God bless you.
"
1947,Actress in a Supporting Role,Gentleman's Agreement,Celeste Holm," CELESTE HOLM:
Thank you, Mr. Crisp.  Ladies and gentlemen, I have thought before tonight that I had already received the greatest award that an actress can have, which is to play a part in a picture in which one so wholeheartedly believes as ""Gentleman's Agreement.""  Thank you, everybody, for making this happen.  I am very proud to be a member of an industry which can promote so much understanding in a world which seems to need it so much.
"
1949,Actress,The Heiress,Olivia de Havilland," OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND:

"
1950,Actress in a Supporting Role,Harvey,Josephine Hull," JOSEPHINE HULL:
How wonderful of you.  Thank you all very much, and Mr. Brackett and all of the Academy.  I've heard of these wonderful occasions for years and this is the first time I've been here.  I must thank that 6 foot 4½ inch ""Harvey"" [pointing up to a tall nothing standing beside her].  ""Harvey"" has brought happiness for the past seven years all the way from Boston and New York, and here, which is the gateway to the world through Universal International.  And they gave us a wonderful director, a wonderful staff, a wonderful cast, and you.  Thank you.

Thank you. Oh it was a long walk, I didn't think I was going to make it. Well I'm very proud and I'm very grateful, especially to Columbia Pictures. It was a wonderful, wonderful experience, ""From Here to Eternity,"" but I think even more wonderful is from ""Eternity"" to here. Thank you.

Thank you all so much. I'd like to, I don't know how much time we have, but I'd like to accept this award in the name of my late little brother Bill. And I'd like to thank especially the Academy because I'm sure that this year, the four other girls, such stiff competition, it was a real... I really appreciate it. And I know I haven't got time to thank such loyal friends as Edna Benoit, and my producer Mr. Zugsmith. And Universal and all it's board of directors have been, had such confidence in me, like Mr. Muhl. And I want to thank the Screen Extras Guild and the Screen Actors Guild because we've had a lot of ups and downs together, and you understand all the crews I've worked with. Thank you so much and God love you all.
"
1957,Actress,The Three Faces of Eve,Joanne Woodward," JOANNE WOODWARD:

Thank you.  I really don't know what to say.  I wish somebody were to help me right now, 'cause I didn't expect so I had nothing in my mind.  But right now I thank you for everyone who help me, and you, and you, and all American people.  Thank you.

"
1959,Actress,Room at the Top,Simone Signoret," SIMONE SIGNORET:
I can't say anything. Oh, I thank you. I thank you so much. I wanted to be very dignified and all that, well I can't. You can't imagine what it is for me, being French. You can't imagine. And I want to thank Jimmy Woolf, and Jack Clayton, and Laurence Harvey because, it looks a little corny to say that, but you know that without them I wouldn't have never been here tonight. Thank you so, so much.
"
1959,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Diary of Anne Frank,Shelley Winters," SHELLEY WINTERS:
You know, it takes a lot of people to put this in your hand. First, someone has to write a dimensional role in a very fine motion picture. And next, somebody has to get you the part. Then you have to have a great director. And then you have to be nominated and voted. So I would like to thank the memory of that wonderful little girl, Miss Anne Frank, who wrote with such depth and perception about human beings. I'd like to thank my wonderful friend and creative agent, Mr. Herb Brenner. And Mr. George Stevens. And last but not least, I thank you, the Academy.

Thank you very much. I can only think that I wouldn't be standing here tonight accepting this Oscar if it weren't for another Oscar – Hammerstein – and Mr. Richard Rodgers. And also for the belief of Mr. Burt Lancaster, Mr. Richard Brooks, and Mr. Bernie Smith having me and allowing me to play the part of ""Lulu Bains"" in ""Elmer Gantry."" This is the proudest moment of my career because of them. Thank you all.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, this is lovely. I know you Americans are famous for your hospitality but this is really ridiculous. I have so many thank yous. I only know where to start and that's with Mr. Walt Disney, and naturally he has the largest thank you of all. I wouldn't know where to stop. I would somehow like to try and convey my really deep gratitude and, and well, gratefulness – well I just said that, hadn't I? – for being made to feel so really welcome in this country. Thank you very much indeed.

Thank you very much, members of the Academy, for giving this to me the second time in my life. I wish to thank very much my director, Mr. Guy Green, who truly understood the role I played better than I did. And I would like to especially thank Mr. Pandro Berman for not only making such a sensitive, beautiful picture about a subject of integration such as ""A Patch of Blue"" is, but for making the picture a box-office success, which is very important for subjects like these. And I'd like to thank my agent again, Herb Brenner. Thank you.

Boy, it's heavy! I have to thank David Merrick who let me out of my Broadway play ""The Seven Descents of Myrtle"" so I could be here this evening, and little did he know what it would really mean to me. I also first want to express my great gratitude to Arthur Penn, my own particular genius, for really showing me acting was something very special. And, of course, to Warren Beatty. And thank you all. This is a great moment.

1968,Actress,Funny Girl,Barbra Streisand," BARBRA STREISAND:
[To the Oscar:]  Hello, gorgeous.

And I'm very honored to be in such magnificent company as Katharine Hepburn. And gee whiz, it's kind of a wild feeling. Sitting there tonight I was thinking that the first script of ""Funny Girl"" was written when I was only eleven years old, and thank God it took so long to get it right, you know. So I would like to thank my co-producer Ray Stark for waiting till I grew up. And Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, for giving me such a great score to sing. And Isobel Lennart, for writing such a terrific character. And all the Hollywood people who made our show into a movie: Herb Ross, and my dear Harry Stradling who I haven't let go since, and my dear friend and director, William Wyler. Wow. It's like, somebody once said to me, asked me, if I was happy. And I said, ""Are you kidding? I'd be miserable if I was happy."" And I'd like to thank all the members of the Academy for making me really miserable. Thank you.

I can't tell you how encouragin' a thing like this is. The first film that I was ever in was in 1915 and here we are and it's 1969. Actually, I don't know why it took me so long; though I don't think, you know, that I'm backward. Anyway. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Roman. And thank you, Mia.

MARTHA RAYE:
[To Bob Hope:] Oh, I'm sorry...

Academy, ladies and gentlemen, my dear, beautiful legend Bob Hope. This is the most beautiful, honorable, wonderful, exciting day of my life – stateside.

1971,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Last Picture Show,Cloris Leachman," CLORIS LEACHMAN:
Oh, thank you.  I'm having an amazing life and it isn't over yet.  Remember when Ben Johnson said in ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""I fought all my life against..."" whatever he said.  And I feel I've fought all my life against clichés, and look at me, I'm a hopeless cliché.

I can't thank anybody.  I feel that we all have, are part of each other. That we've all contributed.  And we work together and we're all the same people. And I love you all for all the experiences I've had.  Except that I want to say to Cornelia Williams Hurlbut, my first piano teacher, and Rose Lorenz, my dancing teacher in Des Moines, and my father Buck Leachman who paid the bills – wait – and finally my mother, whose imagination and funny sense of humor and almost Walter Mitty life herself led to all of this.  I'm deeply honored. Thank you.
"
1972,Actress,Cabaret,Liza Minnelli," LIZA MINNELLI:

Making the film of ""Cabaret"" was one of the happiest times of my whole life and I would like to thank everybody connected with it but most especially the artistic staff:  Mr. Fosse, and Fred Ebb and John Kander.

"
1972,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,None,Rosalind Russell," ROSALIND RUSSELL:
Frank, you shouldn't go away; it seems like we've stood this way before.  But thank you dear, dear, wonderful friend.

And of course I am profoundly grateful to the governors of the Academy.  I was listening to his words back there, Frank, and I thought for a minute, someone out there'll think I was kind of special – far from it.  You know the people of this nation have a golden tradition of taking care of each other. And across America right now there are men and women, countless numbers of them, young and old, who are giving of themselves to hospitals, to orphanages, to drug clinics, to youth, and even possibly watching a little child take her first steps after being crippled as I have watched.  So the only unique thing about me tonight is that I am here with this, knowing that it belongs to so many others.  I would also like to tell you that I have been the victim of this kindness, and I want to thank each and every one of them and all the letters that were sent to me over the years for all they did for me while I was not quite well.  Thank you very much.

"
1974,Actress in a Supporting Role,Murder on the Orient Express,Ingrid Bergman," INGRID BERGMAN:
Thank you very much indeed.  It's always very nice to get an Oscar.  But in the past he has shown that he is very forgetful and also has the wrong timing. Because last year when ""Day and Night"" won for the best picture I couldn't believe it that Valentina Cortese was not nominated, because she gave the most beautiful performance.  [Finds Cortese in the audience:]  There you are!  She gave the most beautiful performance that all we actresses recognized because, after all, we have all forgotten our lines and always open the wrong doors, and it was wonderful to see her do it so beautifully.  Therefore I am... It's so ironic that this year she's nominated when the picture won last year.  I don't quite understand that, but here I am and I'm her rival and I don't like it at all.  Please forgive me, Valentina.  I didn't mean to.  Thank you.

1975,Actress,One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,Louise Fletcher," LOUISE FLETCHER:
Well, it looks like you all hated me so much that you've given me this award for it, and I'm loving every minute of it.  And all I can say is I've loved being hated by you.  I'd like to thank Fred Roos for remembering me, Milos Forman for choosing me, Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz for taking a chance and giving me a chance, and Jack Nicholson and a cast of actors whose professionalism, humor and capacity for getting into their roles made being in a mental institution like being in a mental institution.  And if you'll excuse me [using sign language]:  for my mother and my father, I want to say thank you for teaching me to have a dream.  You are seeing my dream come true. Thank you.

1975,Actress in a Supporting Role,Shampoo,Lee Grant," LEE GRANT:
Thank you.  I really must have won it otherwise why would I wear an old wedding dress?  I think we [referring to the Oscar] had a fight twenty years ago, but he's changed.  I know I haven't.  But I would like to thank the artistic community for sustaining me in my wins and losses and sitting on the curb, whatever it was.  I don't think there's an award for what Warren Beatty had to do to get ""Shampoo"" on, but I respect him and love him, and Robert Towne.  And my director Hal Ashby, who encourages an actor to fly without a net because you know that he's there to catch you.  Thank you.
"
1975,Film Editing,Jaws,Verna Fields," VERNA FIELDS:
At first, I want to say that giving me this I consider a great tribute to our wonderful, fabulous, talented director, Steven Spielberg.  I would also like to say that being here at this time, after all these years, I really have a long list of thank yous which I won't bother you with, but I hope everybody on that list, primarily my two sons—I say thank you.

1976,Actress in a Leading Role,Network,Faye Dunaway," FAYE DUNAWAY:
It is heavy.  Well, I didn't expect this to happen quite yet but I do thank you very much and I'm very grateful.  I would like especially to thank Sidney Lumet, Paddy Chayefsky, Howard Gottfried, Danny Melnick, and the great generosity of a rare group of actors, company of actors, in particular William Holden, Robert Duvall and Peter Finch.  And may I just add, an especial thank you to the friends in the back room:  Susan Germaine and Lee Harman.  Thank you.
"
1976,Actress in a Supporting Role,Network,Beatrice Straight," BEATRICE STRAIGHT:
It's very heavy.  And I'm the dark horse.  And thank you so much, all of you. It's a great, great thrill for me and very unexpected.  Though I should have known that when I had someone like Paddy Chayefsky writing and saying things that we all feel but can't express, and when we have someone like Sidney Lumet who makes one want to act forever, and a producer like Howard Gottfried, then how can I miss?  But I know that my mother would be delighted.  She had great potential for an actress but didn't think she should do it, so she pushed me and was delighted.  And Michael Chekhov, the great actor and teacher who I studied with, who gave me a love and respect for the theater, which is the whole point of why we're all here.  It's a great profession and we have to keep thinking it all the time.  And we all do.  And we all love it.  And I'm so grateful for that and for a wonderful lady, age ninety-three, who lives here in Los Angeles, who's watching tonight.  One of our first women directors, who directed Paul Robeson in ""Othello"" in London:  Ellen van Volkenburg Browne.  Bright as ever.  Thank you.  And last but not least, my husband, who's put up with me for twenty-eight years.  Thank you so, so much.

1977,Actress in a Leading Role,Annie Hall,Diane Keaton," DIANE KEATON:
Mercy.  Well then, this is terrific.  It's simply terrific.  Naturally I'm very honored to have been nominated with actresses like Jane Fonda and Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft and Marsha Mason; this is something.  Anyway, ""Annie Hall"" was a wonderful experience for me and I just would like to say thanks to Woody, and thank you.  Thank you very much.
"
1977,Actress in a Supporting Role,Julia,Vanessa Redgrave," VANESSA REDGRAVE:
My dear colleagues, I thank you very, very much for this tribute to my work. I think that Jane Fonda and I have done the best work of our lives and I think this was in part due to our director, Fred Zinnemann.  And I also think it's in part because we believed and we believe in what we were expressing. Two, out of millions, who gave their lives and were prepared to sacrifice everything in the fight against fascist and racist Nazi Germany.  And I salute you and I pay tribute to you and I think you should be very proud that in the last few weeks you've stood firm and you have refused to be intimidated by the threats of a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums whose behavior is an insult to the stature of Jews all over the world and to their great and heroic record of struggle against fascism and oppression.  And I salute that record, and I salute all of you for having stood firm and dealt a final blow against that period when Nixon and McCarthy launched a worldwide witch hunt against those who tried to express in their lives and their work the truth that they believed in.  I salute you, and I thank you, and I pledge to you that I will continue to fight against anti-Semitism and fascism.  Thank you.

1978,Actress in a Leading Role,Coming Home,Jane Fonda," JANE FONDA:
[Speaking simultaniously in sign language:]  I'm so happy.  I wanted to win very much because I'm so proud of ""Coming Home,"" and I want many people to see the movie.  I'm signing part of what I'm saying tonight because, while we were making the movie, we all became more aware of the problems of the handicapped. Over 14 million people are deaf.  They are the invisible handicapped and can't share this evening, so this is my way of acknowledging them.  [End sign language.]

I'm so proud and grateful.  It's been almost eight years.  This film, ""Coming Home,"" was born in Santa Monica where we live, in the cramped offices of the Indochina Peace Campaign, as a lot of us whose lives have been bound up with the war sat on the floor.  And some of them were veterans.  I thank, I thank all of them.  One of them was my husband, Tom Hayden; one of them was Bruce Gilbert, who has become my partner and is the associate producer of ""Coming Home.""

I want to thank Waldo Salt, the first – how do you...?  Heavy.  The first industry heavy who stuck his neck out and believed in the project.  In fact he believed so much in it that he worked for two years for nothing.  And he lead us to Jerry Hellman, our producer, who fought for us.  And I want to thank you, Jerry, very much.  And I want to thank Haskell Wexler who photographed it so sensitively and Bob Jones who came through in the pinch.  And I want to thank Hal Ashby; you're not here, Hal, but I want to thank you for your taste and for your courage, for your ability with the scissors.  And I want to thank Penny Milford and Bobby Carradine and Bruce Dern and my pal Jon Voight, and Mike Medavoy and Eric Pleskow and Arthur Krim and Marcia Nasatir for getting us the money to make it.

And finally I want to thank my children, Troy and Vanessa, for being understanding and forgiving me my absences.  And again my husband, who helped me believe that besides being entertaining movies can inspire and teach and even be healing.  Thank you, all of you.  Thank the Academy very much.

I just, I just really can't believe it.  I'm very, very honored and very grateful.  I would like to thank Neil Simon.  I would like to thank Herbie Ross.  And I would very much like Michael Caine to be here, because believe you me, he was the most supporting actor ever in the world, and it really should go right down the middle.  Thank you very much indeed.
"
1979,Actress in a Leading Role,Norma Rae,Sally Field," SALLY FIELD:
Oh, I'm gonna be the one to cry tonight, I'll tell you right now.  They said this couldn't be done.

""Norma Rae"" was a real gift to me.  It was given to me by Laddie and Jay and Gareth of the old Fox.  It was given to me by Alex Rose and Tamara Asseyev, who fought very hard to get it made.  It was given to me by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr.  And it truly was a gift, every single word.  It was given to me by John Alonzo, who followed me around with a camera and never hoped to shine himself, just gave it all to me.  It was given to me by the actors, especially Beau Bridges and Ron Leibman, whose real craft and talent and love and support is why I'm here.

And mostly it was given to me because of Marty Ritt.  Marty Ritt is ""Norma Rae.""  He has fought all his life to put on films that are courageous, that say things, that are part of him that he feels should be said, that have the box-office potential of seventy-five cents, sometimes less.  And I thank him for that.  He's taught me a lot.  And the best gift that Marty gave me was that he let me feel all the time that I was doing it myself, and I know that I didn't.

And on a personal note, I'd like to thank my mother and my sister for holding me together and just plain old holding me.  And my kids, Peter and Eli, for being my constant inspiration, and no matter how many awards I win, if it weren't them I wouldn't be worth a damn.  Thank you very much.

Oh my goodness.  I want to thank all of you so much.  I'm...this is the greatest.  I...for the first time in my life I'm speechless.  I started to work on ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" with a bunch of strangers and I finished working on ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" with a bunch of friends.  And I want to thank Loretta Lynn, and my wonderful director Michael Apted, and Tommy Lee Jones—my Doolittle—and Beverly D'Angelo, and Bob Larson, and Sean Daniel, and Bernie Schwartz, and Michael Chinich, and Tom Rickman, and Joe Tompkins, and Pam Wise.  And the lady who gave me all that hair, Lorraine Roberson.  And my wonderful husband Jack.  And all the cast and crew that worked on ""Coal Miner's Daughter.""  I share this with you and I love you.

1980,Actress in a Supporting Role,Melvin and Howard,Mary Steenburgen," MARY STEENBURGEN:
Well I'm gonna to have to figure out something new to dream about, that's for sure.  Nobody ever accused me of being a fast talker but I'm gonna try tonight because this supporting actress was supported by a great many people, a few whom I would like to quickly thank.

I'd like to thank my family in Arkansas for always believing against all odds that something like this was gonna happen.  And then I'd like to thank two teachers, Sandy Meisner and Kenneth Gillam*, for the profound influence that they had upon my work.  And then if anybody ever had a patron saint it was me. In 1977, when he insisted on casting me as his leading lady in a film called ""Goin' South,"" everybody told him he was crazy.  But thank goodness for me that he was and is Jack Nicholson.  Thank you very much.

There's a couple more.  Thank you, Melvin Dummar, for the inspiration.  Bo Goldman, for the simple splendor of your words.  And Jonathan Demme, thank you for your vision and your talent and for the plain, old-fashioned fun it was to work with you.  Thank you, Don Phillips and Art Linson, our producers.  Jason Robards, Paul Le Mat, Pamela Reed and the rest of the wonderful cast and crew of ""Melvin and Howard.""  And last of all, I must thank you, Malcolm, for making life so nice that I feel like tap dancing.  Thanks a lot.

Thank you very much. I'm very proud to have this. I want to thank, first of all, Marty Scorsese; he edited this film with me every minute of the time. I want to thank him particularly for his brilliant direction, and Robert De Niro for his incredible performance which gave me gold to work with, pure gold. Of course all the members of my staff and the dubbing crew, particularly my first assistant, Sonya Polonsky, who worked so incredibly hard on the film. Frank Warner, for his wonderful sound effects editing job. And lastly, Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff, for their tremendous support during the making of the film. Thank you very, very much.

Oh, boy!  No matter how much you try to imagine what this is like, it's just so incredibly thrilling, right down to your toes.  I have a lot of people to thank and I'm going to be one of those people that tries to mention a lot of names because I know just two seconds ago my mother and father went completely berserk and I'd like to give some other mothers and fathers that opportunity.

I'd like to thank William Styron for creating this beautiful character and Alan Pakula for bringing it to the stage and allowing me to play it.  I would like to thank Marty Starger and ITC for finding the financing for it.  Nestor Almendros, the great cinematographer.  Albert Wolsky, wonderful costumer.  And the crew: Tommy Priestly, the Gerardos, the De Blau brothers, Tommy Prate, Chris Newman, Denny Maitland, Wally Props, Lillian, Alba, Dixie*, Roy Helland. I'd like to thank my Polish coach Elena Bakow*.  My German coaches Anne Cattaneo and David Friedman*.  And the thirty-seven members of the American and European casts, whom I won't mention all of their names but for two.  I feel like I owe them this because everything that I had I got from looking in their eyes and for the great love they gave me for five months.  I thank Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol.

Oh, this is so exciting.  I want to thank you all very, very much.  This means so much to me.  Thank you.
"
1983,Actress in a Leading Role,Terms of Endearment,Shirley MacLaine," SHIRLEY MacLAINE:
I'm gonna cry because this show has been as long as my career.  I have wondered for twenty-six years what this would feel like.  Thank you so much for terminating the suspense.  Oh my, I am nervous.

I'm not going to thank everybody I've ever met in my entire life -- although, with the way my mind has been going lately probably everybody I've ever met in my entire life and in the other life I might have had had something to do with this.  You know, if ""Terms of Endearment"" had happened to me five years ago, I think I would have called it a thrilling, commercial, artistic accident.  But I don't believe that anymore.  I don't believe there's any such thing as accident.  I think that we all manifest what we want and what we need.  I don't think there's any difference really between what you feel you have to do in your heart and success.  They're inseparable.

Jim Brooks deeply wanted to make a film about the defects and imperfections and foibles of people in a humorous and loving way.  And he had such passion. It was unbelievable to watch.  He's being very modest with himself tonight. It was unbelievable.  His sense of truth was so accurate that he overwhelmed his own insecurities, and Paramount's.  I guess we all did the same thing.

I have wanted to work with the comic chemistry of Jack Nicholson since his chicken salad sandwich scene in ""Easy Pieces.""  And to have him in bed was such middle-aged joy.  I wanted to work with the turbulent brilliance of Debra Winger.  She literally inhabited the character so thoroughly that I thought for four months I had two daughters.

But in the end just let me say one thing.  Films and life are like clay waiting for us to mold it.  And when you trust your own insides, and that becomes achievement, it's a kind of a principle that seems to me is at work with everyone.  God bless that principle.  God bless that potential that we all have for making anything possible if we think we deserve it.  I deserve this.  Thank you.
"
1983,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Year of Living Dangerously,Linda Hunt," LINDA HUNT:
This is extraordinary.  There was an Indonesian phrase in the film which translates into English as ""water from the moon.""  And it means that which is unattainable, the impossible, that which one can never have or know.  Making ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" for me was ""water from the moon.""

I want to thank the members of the Academy so much for honoring me with this recognition and this encouragement at the beginning of my work in film, when I still have so much to learn about such a complex and a powerful medium.  And I want to dedicate this to my parents and to Peter Weir, with much love.  And to everyone I love who is out there watching tonight, here is the sign [kisses her thumb then holds it up].  Thank you.

Oh, Benton, what you did for me; you changed my life, truly.  This means so much more to me this time.  I don't know why.  I think the first time I hardly felt it because it was all so new.  I owe a lot to the cast, to my players, to Lindsay and John and Danny and Ed and Amy and my little friends Gennie and Yankton.  I owe a lot to my family for holding me together and loving me and having patience with this obsession of me.  But I want to say thank you to you.  I haven't had an orthodox career and I've wanted more than anything to have your respect.  The first time I didn't feel it, but this time I feel it. And I can't deny the fact that you like me.  Right now, you like me!  Thank you.

Well, thank Horton Foote for all this.  I'm so glad that the members of the Academy responded to ""Carrie Watts"" the way I did, evidently.  That's because the way he wrote it.  And I want to thank you for this for all of us in the company:  John Heard, and Carlin, and Richard Bradford, and Rebecca.  And it was all through the beautiful eye of Fred Murphy and the masterful direction, and his film debut as a director, Peter Masterson.  But mainly it's Horton's fault for all this.  So I thank you all.

I'd like to thank everyone I worked on with the movie [sic].  They were really fabulous.  It was really a great experience for me.  My makeup man, who had a lot to work with; my hairdresser; my assistant; my children, who've been so wonderful.  The lady who taught me how to speak in this Brooklyn accent.

And I would like to thank the women that I was nominated along with, because I feel really, really good because they were so great.  And I would also like to thank Mary Louise Streep, who I feel so unbelievable that I did my first movie with her and now I was nominated with her, and I feel really thankful.

And I'd like to thank all of my families, the tribes that I come from.  The wonderful crew on ""The Accused,"" Jonathan Kaplan, Kelly McGillis, Tom Topor.  Paramount, the Academy, my schools—thank my schools.  And my family.  All my brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers out there.  And most importantly my mother Brandy, who taught me that all of my finger paintings were Picassos, and that I didn't have to be afraid.

I'd like to thank Jim Sheridan and Shane Connaughton for the best script I've ever been involved in.  I'd like to thank Noel Pearson for producing the film.

I'd like to thank William Goldman for bringing the wonderful, crazy ""Annie Wilkes"" to the screen and Stephen King for thinking of her in the first place.

And I'd like to thank Ted Tally, and Thomas Harris, Jesse Kornbluth, everybody at Orion—the way it used to be, and the way it will always be in my heart.  John Douglas and everybody at Quantico.  The incredible cast and crew of ""Silence of the Lambs"" that Jonathan put together.  And of course, the reason that I'm here, Anthony Hopkins.  Quid pro quo, Doctor.

1991,Actress in a Supporting Role,The Fisher King,Mercedes Ruehl," MERCEDES RUEHL:
Thank you.  I went to New York to study acting the summer that I was twenty-one.  And like thousands of actors before me and thousands of actors after me, I went through the usual scores of moonlighting jobs, the usual scores of rejection, and the usual legions of prophets of doom who are always there and always at the ready to give you the up-to-minute odds against your ever making anything of yourself in this business.  And at this moment, all of those sort of doleful memories have suddenly transformed themselves into nothing more than the sort of charming and amusing anecdotes for my memoirs! I cannot, cannot thank you enough.

There are a few people I'd like to thank with all my heart, very quickly. The great Terry Gilliam.  Richard LaGravenese, our screenwriter.  An extraordinary cast; it was an honor to work with them.  Roger Pratt, our cinematographer. Steve Randall, Lynda Obst, Debra Hill, Howard Feuer, Marsha McManus.  My family and my close friends, for their patience and their respect and their support.  And finally I would like to thank Albert Innaurato and the late Joseph Papp who gave me my first shot on the New York stage and my first break in the big time.  And especially the late, great Joe Papp, who once in a rehearsal for that play nudged me out of the shadow and into the light and told me to stay there in no uncertain terms.  I have.  I do.  I will.  Thanks, Joe.  Thank you.

Ridley, I couldn't thank you in forty-five years much less forty-five seconds so I won't try now.  Geena and Susan, I think you've made the world a better place for those performances.  I love you.  I want to thank my husband who helped me so much in ways that I could never tell him, and it wasn't by being like ""Darryl.""  He wasn't the model for any of the characters. In fact my brother was.  I'm just kidding.  I really want to thank my mother who taught me everything about love and loyalty that a gal could ever need to know.  And all my friends and family, thank you.  Thanks.

1992,Actress in a Leading Role,Howards End,Emma Thompson," EMMA THOMPSON:
Ladies and gentlemen, I really don't know how to thank the Academy, not only for this [referring to the Oscar], but also for this view.  Because it's overwhelming to see so many faces who've entertained and influenced me and thrilled me all my life, and it just takes my breath away.  And if I could thank you all I would, but I have more pressing debts:  to E. M. Forster, for creating ""Margaret Schlegel;"" to James Ivory, for asking me to play her; to Ismail Merchant, for paying me to play her, which feels very unnecessary at this moment.  Actually, I think I might have to give back the money.  And to Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, for her flawless adaptation.  To a superlative cast and crew.  To Sony Pictures Classics, for their dedication and commitment.  And especially to Sir Anthony Hopkins, for being, like this, the (k)night of my life.  And finally I would like, if I may, to dedicate this Oscar to the heroism and the courage of women, and to hope that it inspires the creation of more true screen heroines to represent them.

And to the whole circle and the team, Suzan and Gina and Scott and Evelyn and Kate McGregor-Stewart and Francesco Pugliese.  And my very brave family.  Thank you very much.

1992,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,None,Elizabeth Taylor," ELIZABETH TAYLOR:
Thank you so much.  I have been on this stage many times as a presenter, I have sat in the audience as a loser, and I have had the thrill and the honor of standing here as a winner.  But I never ever thought I would come out here to receive this award.  It is the highest possible accolade I could receive from my peers, and for doing something I just have to do, that my passion must do.  I am filled with pride and humility.

I accept this award in honor of all the men, women and children with AIDS who are waging incredibly valiant battles for their lives, those to whom I have given my commitment, the real heroes of the pandemic of AIDS.  I am so proud of the work that people in Hollywood have done to help so many others, like dearest, gentle Audrey [Hepburn].  And while she is, I know, in heaven, forever guarding her beloved children, I will remain here as rowdy an activist as I have to be and, God willing, for as long as I have to be.

Tonight I am asking for your help.  I call upon you to draw from the depths of your being to prove that we are a human race.  To prove that our love outweighs our need to hate.  That our compassion is more compelling than our need to blame.  That our sensitivity to those in need is stronger than our greed.  That our ability to reason overcomes our fear.  And that at the end of each of our lives, we can look back and be proud that we have treated others with the kindness, dignity and respect that every human being deserves.  Thank you and God bless.

1993,Actress in a Leading Role,The Piano,Holly Hunter," HOLLY HUNTER:
I'm so overwhelmed.  To be with that group of actresses just slays me.  When I was six years old I started pretending to play the piano on the window sills of my bedroom in the house where I grew up.  And then after a while my parents realized that I wasn't going to stop, so they got me a cardboard keyboard to play to see if that might, you know, if I would get tired of that.  But I wasn't.  I didn't.  And so then they got me a piano.  So for the next ten years they let me have piano lessons.  So I need to thank Eileen Parish, my first piano teacher, and I need to thank my parents for letting me have these lessons.

And Jane Campion, I love you, I love you.  Thank you so much for giving me a character and an experience that was so difficult to say good-bye to, except that I don't have to say good-bye to it because it's everybody's now.  And that is such a gift.  And Michael Nyman, who really gave me a veritable instruction manual for a way into ""Ada McGrath"" by giving the music, giving me the music that he gave me and the entire movie to experience.  And Jan Chapman, our producer, for being so luminous and for giving ""The Piano"" and all of us a place to flourish.  Harvey and Bob Weinstein, you also break my heart with your uncensored passion and support for this movie.  And just thank you all so much for letting this movie in.  And thanks.

1993,Writing (Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen),The Piano,Jane Campion," JANE CAMPION:
Well, when I was a student, which doesn't feel like so very long ago, I used to feel deeply cynical about awards nights like this, but tonight I'm really overwhelmed.  In fact I've been close to tears a few times.  And I'm just very pleased to be here and very proud to win this award.  And I'd like to say a very big thank you to my actors: Holly; Anna; Harvey and Sam who aren't here but were such gorgeous, tender, and vulnerable men in ""The Piano.""  I'd like to say, Michael Nyman, your music was just so extraordinary.  To me it was the heart of the film.  Jan, thank you for being my friend and producer.  A great big kiss to you, Colin, my husband.  And a special thank you to the Miramax brothers, Harvey and Bob, for bringing this film to America.  Thank you very much.

I want to thank the Academy so much.  This is such a wonderful honor, especially for a little film that seemed to have no future.  And it's just such a great honor.  I want to thank Orion Films, past and present, especially Marc Platt for letting us do this very peculiar little film in the first place.  And my dear friend Lynn Arost, the producer, who really stuck by the film even when it was sitting on a shelf in a bank vault in New York City.  To the writers of course, who created a marvelous character.  To the players, a wonderful group of actors that I was fortunate to work with, especially Mr. Tommy Lee Jones who really made the performance that I gave possible.  This is really a tribute to Tony Richardson.  He loved actors.  He loved everything about it.  He loved the acting, and he was the perfect person for me to work with.  He just kept nudging me over the edge, and with a character like this it's exactly what I needed.  And last of all, to my three children, who make all of this possible with their love and patience.  So thank you very, very much.

Oh gosh, just let me put on my glasses.  This is as surprising and marvelous as it was the first time.  Although this time I need glasses!  It's a difference.

I'm so privileged to be in the company of these gifted women, including Jennifer Tilly, my colleague, who's so wonderful.  I'm in debt to my loyal friend and remarkable artist, Woody Allen.  He gave me such a gift with this role.  And with this gift came acting with John Cusack, being lit by the great cinematographer Carlo Di Palma, costumed by Jeffrey Kurland, working with Santo Loquasto, a great cast, a great crew.  My thanks also to Tracey Jacobs, Bobby Greenhut, Jean Doumanian, and Harvey and Bob Weinstein.  I have to thank my family:  Martha, Harris Yulin, Kathleen Tolan, my brothers Greg and Donny, Clarice, the Steve Tesiches, Arlene Donovan, and my sweet daughters and their sweet patience, Emily and Lily, without whom nothing is anything.  And Sam Cohn is their godfather.  If the world was a perfect place every kid would have a godfather like Sam.

Oh, my.  Thank you, members of the Academy, for including me in the fine presence of these other great actors and for giving me this opportunity to thank people that are so dear to my heart for making this happen.

Sam Cohn, my dear friend Elaine Goldsmith, Arlene Donovan, you should be so happy because this would not have happened without you.  Big thanks to Martha Luttrell and Nancy Seltzer for their support.

To the crew who worked so hard and so well for so little to keep me safe and make me laugh and do their job, I thank you.  The crew, the rest of the ensemble, especially Celia, Ray Barry, R. Lee Ermey, Roberta Maxwell, Lois Smith.  All those mothers and fathers without whose strong performances the film would not have been as balanced and had as much dignity as it did, I thank you for that.  Big thanks to Sean Penn for your intelligence and your courage and your humor, and your hair-do.  It was a great dance.  Thank you so much.

To my kids, Eva, Jack Henry, and Miles.  Thanks for being such good sports, and who were in the movie and did a great job.  And finally, to my partner in crime and in all things of the heart, the writer, the producer, the director, the spirit, Tim Robbins.  You kept us on track, you fought so hard.

I always looked at great performances and was so moved by how much other people's hearts made me feel as a child.  And I wanted to be an actor who could move other people and make other people see something about the human spirit, and you've made me feel that I've made a small step towards that.  So thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.

I don't really know how to thank the Academy for this.  And if I try we'll be here till Christmas, so I better get on.  Before I came I went to visit Jane Austen's grave in Winchester Cathedral to pay my respects, you know, and to tell her about the grosses.  And I don't know how she would react to an evening like this but I do hope, I do hope she knows how big she is in Uruguay.  Profound thanks to Columbia Pictures and the lovely forms of Lisa Henson, Gareth Wigan, and Mark Canton for hiring a first-time writer.  To James Schamus, for his rare intelligence.  And to Sydney Pollack, for asking all the right questions like, why couldn't these women go out and get a job? Why, indeed!  And to the cast and crew, for being impeccable.  To my friend and my teacher, Lindsay Doran, for being the single, most frustrating reason why I can't claim all the credit for myself.  And finally I would like, with your permission, to dedicate this Oscar to our director Ang Lee.  Ang, wherever you are, this is for you.

1996,Actress in a Leading Role,Fargo,Frances McDormand," FRANCES McDORMAND:
It is impossible to maintain one's composure in this situation.  What am I doing here?  Especially considering the extraordinary group of women with whom I was nominated.  We five women were fortunate to have the choice, not just the opportunity but the choice, to play such rich, complex female characters. And I congratulate producers like Working Title and Polygram for allowing directors to make autonomous casting decisions based on qualifications and not just market value.  And I encourage writers and directors to keep these really interesting female roles coming, and while you're at it you can throw in a few for the men as well.

My family, friends and colleagues here tonight and all around the world, they know exactly who they are, you know who you are.  And I hope you already know how much your support and your care means to me, but I'm gonna name three. The co-writer/director and producer of ""Fargo,"" Mr. Ethan Coen, who helped make an actor of me.  His brother, Mr. Joel Coen, who made a woman of me.  And our moon and our sun, Mr. Pedro McDormand Coen, who has made a real mother of me. Thank you for acknowledging our work.

What a thrill.  You know you've entered new territory when you realize that your outfit cost more than your film.  You think I'm joking, but... This was a labor of love involving much of both from some very wonderful people.  Sandy Close from Pacific News Service, Shana Hagan, Sandra Tsing Loh, my family, the funders, the good people at ""Reel Life,"" and my dear husband Mark Salzman. But my deepest thanks must go to Mark O'Brien.  He is a gifted writer who has lived for the past forty-one years paralyzed in an iron lung.  Mark hates to be called brave or courageous because he's never wanted to be seen as a hero, but, more importantly, as a human being.  Well, Mark, it was not your bravery but your humanity that earned this award.  Cheers.

The first time I saw ""Mrs. Brown"" -- saw it three times.  The first time I saw it, I leaned over to my beloved and said, ""She's [Judi Dench] going to win an Academy Award.""  And in my mind tonight she has.  And so has Julie Christie, and so has Helena Bonham Carter, and so has Kate Winslet.  And for that matter so has Billy Connolly, and so has Ben Affleck, and so has Joan Allen.  And I am honored to work in a year when there were so many magnificent performances.

I am here for one reason and that's Jim Brooks.  One single reason, and that's the only reason really.  That's the only reason.  I thank -- I am tired of thanking you -- I thank God for giving me a little piece of you.  Jack, I worship you, you know it.  Greg, I hope you hold in your heart how beautiful your performance in this movie was.  I would like to thank our producers Bridget Johnson, Kristi Zea, Larry Mark.  Everyone at Sony.  The team of experts it took to make me available for this movie.  My acting teachers Lurene Tuttle, wherever you are, Gordon Hunt, Larry Moss, Gary Austin, for giving me a way to learn about myself and the world, and a way to express myself.  I hate to think who I would be without that.  My parents, who are sobbing at this point.  My friends, who are at home jumping up and down.  And you [Hank Azaria], the very, just the very best man I know.  Thank you so much.  This is a magnificent honor.  Thank you very much.

But I would like to thank Harvey Weinstein and everybody at Miramax Films for their undying support of me.  I would like to -- I wouldn't be in this auditorium, let alone up here, if it wasn't for two incredibly talented men. Our director John Madden, thank you so much for all that you gave me.  You are so inspiring.  And to my soulful partner, Joseph Fiennes, who I share this with.  I wouldn't be here without him.  I would like to thank the rest of our miraculous cast and crew.

I would like to thank my wonderful agent Rick Kurtzman who is a beautiful man and a wonderful agent and in his case that is not an oxymoron.  I would like to thank Harold Brown, Stuart Gelwarg*, and Stephen Huvane.

I would not have been able to play this role had I not understood love of a tremendous magnitude, and for that I thank my family.  My mother Blythe Danner, who I love more than anything, and my brother Jake Paltrow, who is just the dearest person in the whole world.  My earthly guardian angel, Mary Wigmore*.  And especially to my father Bruce Paltrow, who has surmounted insurmountable obstacles this year.  I love you more than anything in the world.  And to my grandpa Buster, who almost made it here tonight, but couldn't quite get here.  Grandpa, I want you to know that you have created a beautiful family who loves you and loves each other more than anything, and we thank you for that.

I feel for eight minutes on the screen I should only get a little bit of him. I do thank the Academy very much indeed.  I do think also that the best bit about the Academy Awards is being nominated.  You live in a kind of haze for several weeks, and the terrible thing is that somebody's got to win.  My heart goes out to all the other four who didn't.  And also, my admiration.

I do have to thank John Madden and Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, as I actually wrote to John Madden after ""Mrs. Brown"" and said, I will do anything in your next film.  If you want somebody to slouch in a doorway, you can count on me.  And I mean it, and I hope he bears me in mind next time.  I do thank you all very much indeed.  I am very moved by it.  Thank you.

Thank you, thank you so much.  We have come a long way.  To think that this movie wouldn't have been made three-and-a-half years ago, and we made it now for under two million dollars.   And now this.  It's quite remarkable.  I want to thank the Academy for their support and recognition of me and my work in a movie that is so important, and I am so proud to be a part of it.

This movie would have never been made -- I had, just on the off chance that I got up here, I brought this piece of paper because I knew I couldn't forget anyone, because everyone put their heart and soul into this movie and God knows no one got paid.  So first, Kimberly Peirce, for her fierce tenacity and vision.  Andy Bienen, our co-writer.  Killer Films, you guys always make important movies and I thank you for that.  John Hart, Jeff Sharp, for being there for me every single minute.  Jim Denault, our cinematographer, who was absolutely brilliant.  Kerry Barden, Jennifer McNamara, for fighting for me, the casting directors.  Chloë Sevigny, the rest of the cast, who portrayed their characters so honestly and brilliantly.  Lee Percy, our editor.

I want to thank Michael Stremel, Lindsay Law and Bill Mechanic and everyone at Fox Searchlight for putting their wing around this small, little movie and giving us wings.  Larry Moss, my acting coach, who, without him, I could have never given this performance.  Thank you, Larry.  My mom, who's up there somewhere [in the balcony].  It looks like living out of our car was worth it. Holly Hein, for keeping my head on straight.  My publicist Troy Nankin, who is a beautiful, beautiful human being.  Kami Putnam, I have to thank you for fighting for me.  I'm almost done, I promise.  The Independent Film Channel, for helping us finish our movie.  And Hylda Queally and David Wirtschafter, for their support.

And last, but certainly not least, I want to thank Brandon Teena for being such an inspiration to us all.

I pray for the day when we not only accept our differences, but we actually celebrate our diversity.  Thank you very much.

I would like to start with telling you all how amazing the experience of feeling the sisterhood of being included in a group with Joan Allen and Juliette Binoche and Laura Linney and Ellen Burstyn for these last weeks has been.  It's just felt like such a triumph to me to be in that list.  My name starts with ""R"" so I'm always last, but I still love the list.

So I thank you for really making me feel so... [laughs!]  I love it up here!  Yeah, anyway, I start working for him again in two days, so I can get to you later.

Hello.  Okay, I brought paper because I didn't want to forget.

Thank you to the members of the Academy for this honor.  By some beautiful twist of fate I've landed in this vocation that demands that I feel and helps me to learn.  I know film has moved or taught me more than a beautiful mind. Thank you to all of our magnificent cast and crew for their invaluable collaboration and most especially to Ron Howard and to Russell Crowe.  Thanks to all the artists who have inspired me and the list is too long.

Thank you so much.  Yes, now I have to think.  David Hare, I need your words. I have such appreciation and gratitude for this.  Russell Crowe said don't cry if you get up there, and now I'm crying.  Sorry.

Paramount and Miramax, you made it.  And Kevin Huvane, Rick Nicita, Marc Epstein stood by me for so many years.  And I am just absolutely thrilled to be standing up here tonight.

I do have to say it was, why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil?  Because art is important.  And because you believe in what you do and you want to honor that.  And it is a tradition that needs to be upheld.  At the same time you say there is a lot of problems in the world. And since 9/11 there's been a lot of pain, in terms of families losing people, and now with the war, families losing people.  And God bless them. And I am standing here in front of my mother and my daughter and my whole life I've wanted to make my mother proud.  And now I want to make my daughter proud.  So thank you.

2002,Costume Design,Chicago,Colleen Atwood," COLLEEN ATWOOD:
""Chicago"" began for me when I walked into a room of mirrors and watched Rob Marshall and three choreographers dance the entire show.  It was a powerful inspiration and continued to be as the collaboration expanded.  Sets, camera, stage lighting, an amazing cast who sang and danced, dancers, and my collaborators--Dale, Karen, Christine--all led by Bill Condon's script and Rob's clarity and heart.  Thanks to you all, and to Miramax and Marty Richards who let it all happen.   Thank you.

Thank you.  This is an amazing honor.  I feel you're also honoring the people of Chernobyl who are suffering the effects of radiation still, eighteen years later after the world's worst accident at the reactor.  I could not have made this film without Adi Roche.  She's up there.  She heads the Chernobyl Children's Project and they are saving lives every day.  Adi is a true hero. Sheila Nevins from HBO has been a wonderful mentor and she's an amazing woman and I wouldn't be standing here without her.  It's not easy to stand here.

I know you think it's cheesy, sweetheart, but I have to thank you, my husband.  And Hylda Queally and Robyn Gardiner, my uber-agents. And the wonderful Lisa Kasteler. Everyone involved in ""The Aviator."" When you play someone as terrifyingly well-known as Katharine Hepburn, it's a collaborative effort; you need as much help as you can get. And thank you, of course, to Miss Hepburn. The longevity of her career, I think, is inspiring to everyone. But most importantly, and on behalf of everyone I know in ""The Aviator,"" thank you to Martin Scorsese. I hope my son will marry your daughter. Thank you.

And you gave us an incredibly dazzling ride on this film and gave us a fantastic group of actors. I truly loved editing your footage and theirs.

There are so many people to thank. I won't thank them, but I think they know who they are: the mixers, the wonderful visual effects people. But particularly my assistants Scott Brock, Tom Foligno and Erin Crackel; they really got it up there on the screen. But it's really you, Marty. It's you. Thank you.

2005,Actress in a Leading Role,Walk the Line,Reese Witherspoon," REESE WITHERSPOON:
Oh my goodness.  I never thought I'd be here in my whole life, growing up in Tennessee.  I want to say that Johnny Cash and June Carter had a wonderful tradition of honoring other artists and musicians and singers, and I really feel that tradition tonight.  It is very important and I really feel it, so I want to thank the Academy for this incredible honor.

I want to say thank you to so many people who helped me create this role. Everyone at Fox; Cathy Konrad, James Keach for producing the film.  A very special thank you to Jim Mangold who directed the film and also wrote this character who is a real woman who has dignity and honor and fear and courage. And she's a real woman and I really appreciate that.  It was an incredible gift that you gave me, so thank you.  And T Bone Burnett for helping me realize my lifelong dream of being a country music singer; thank you, T Bone. And I want to say thank you to Joaquin Phoenix who just put his heart and soul into this performance.  His commitment and passion for this character and for this performance was just remarkable and I feel so lucky to have gone on this journey with you.

I am so blessed to have my family here tonight.  My mother and my father are here.  And I just want to say thank you so much for everything, for being so proud of me.  It didn't matter if I was making my bed or making a movie, they never hesitated to say how proud they were of me and that means so very much to a child.  So thank you, Mom and Dad.  I want to say thank you to my wonderful husband and my two children—who should be going to bed—and thank you for loving me so much and supporting me.  And I want to say that my grandmother was one of the biggest inspirations in my life.  She taught me how to be a real woman, to have strength and self respect, and to never give those things away.  And those are a lot of qualities I saw in June Carter.  And people used to ask June how she was doing, and she used to say: ""I'm just trying to matter.""  And I know what she means.  You know, I'm just trying to matter and live a good life and make work that means something to somebody. And you have all made me feel that I might have accomplished that tonight. So thank you so much for this honor.

I share it with others:  Ralph Fiennes, my luminous acting partner; Fernando Meirelles, our director, who is brimming over with such humanity; and our dignified, sensitive producer, Simon Channing Williams; and of course, John le Carré, who wrote this unflinching, angry story.  And he really paid tribute to the people who are willing to risk their own lives to fight injustice, and they're greater men and women than I.  But thank you, thank you so much. Thank you.

I also share my gold star with the filmmakers: with Stephen Frears, with Peter Morgan, with Andy Harries, and all the producers and all the filmmakers and the cast. Thank you.

She's had her feet planted firmly on the ground, her hat on her head, her handbag on her arm and she's weathered many, many storms.

Oh my God. I have to just take this moment in. I cannot believe this. Look what God can do. If my grandmother--I didn't think I was going to win but, wow, if my grandmother was here to see me now. She was my biggest inspiration for everything because she was a singer, and she had the passion for it but she never had the chance, and that was the thing that pushed me forward to continue. But I'm so grateful to have my mother here celebrating with me. My boyfriend, my sisters and my brothers back home, and then I've got two of them here, thank you all for being here and supporting me. Also I'd like to thank Bill Condon, our director, who's a genius. Wow. Oh my God. Unbelievable cast. I'd like to thank the Academy. Definitely have to thank God, I guess, again. I can't believe this.

I want to thank Francis, first of all, for introducing me to Sofia when we were doing ""Cotton Club."" And she was this [motions to her height as a girl], and now she's my director. I think she did a wonderful movie; her movie is like a poem and she inspired me. I haven't prepared this speech so I have to hurry up because Marshall, my husband, said I have to get out of here quickly. So I want to thank everybody who had anything to do with this movie. Without them I wouldn't be here, and it's a communal effort, therefore thank everybody very, very much. I want to dedicate this award first of all to Momma, then Hugh Hudson, and Stanley Kubrick, my great master. Without them, I wouldn't be here.  Thank you.

2006,Film Editing,The Departed,Thelma Schoonmaker," THELMA SCHOONMAKER:
Thank you. Thank you so much. This is the third film you've given the Oscar to that was made by Martin Scorsese, and believe me I know I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for him. You can understand what it was like to be given a film directed the way he directed this movie, with a wonderful script by Bill Monahan, the fantastic panoply of actors who were just so magnificent. Working with Marty is quite something. It's tumultuous, passionate, funny and it's like being in the best film school in the world. I'm so grateful to you and to my two pillars in the editing room, Scott Brock and Joel Hirsch, and Rob Legato and Ron Ames for putting their arms around us and doing the visual effects and supporting us throughout. And to you, members of the Academy, I feel very honored. Thank you so much.

2006,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,None,Sherry Lansing," SHERRY LANSING:
I am deeply honored and very grateful to receive this award, but I also must admit that it feels a little strange to be singled out; so many of you have causes that you are equally passionate about. That is really what is so wonderful about the movie industry, not only do we get to make films that matter, but we also work in a culture where we are encouraged to speak out. We may not always agree, but we do always care.

Through my work I have met scientists who struggle every day to find cures for diseases.  They do so quietly, without glamour or attention, but always with passion and conviction. I have met school teachers who are battling against insurmountable odds, and yet they never stop trying to reach our children. To me they are the real heroes, and tonight I share this honor with all of them.

On a personal note, I want to thank my husband Billy and our two boys, Cedric and Jack, whose unconditional love gives me the courage to fight every day for what I believe in. And a special thank you to the members of the Academy for this extraordinary honor. I promise to spend the rest of my life trying to live up to it.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.

And I'm giving this to him because there's no way I would be in America at all, ever on a plane, if it wasn't for him.  So, Brian Swardstrom, I'm giving this to you.

And Tony Gilroy walks on water, it's entirely official as far as I'm concerned.  And Jen Fox and Steve Samuels, our incredible producers, and Sydney Pollack.  And George Clooney, you know, the seriousness and the dedication to your art.  Seeing you climb into that rubber bat suit from ""Batman & Robin,"" the one with the nipples, every morning under your costume, on the set, off the set, hanging upside-down at lunch. You rock, man.

Okay, that fainting thing, Penélope.  I'd be lying if I haven't made a version of this speech before.  I think I was probably eight years old and staring into the bathroom mirror and this [holding up her statuette] would've been a shampoo bottle.  Well, it's not a shampoo bottle now!  I feel very fortunate to have made it all the way from there to here and I'd like to thank some of the people along the way who had faith in me.  My friends and my family, especially my mum and dad, who are in this room somewhere.  Dad, whistle or something, 'cause then I'll know where you are.  [Loud whistle.] Yeah!  I love you!

I also want to thank Hylda Queally, Dallas Smith and the late, much loved, much missed Robert Garlock.  And from Peter Jackson and Emma Thompson to my very own Sam and Stephen Daldry.  I'm very lucky to have been given ""Hanna Schmitz"" by Bernhard Schlink and David Hare.  And Stephen, working with you is an experience I will never forget.  There was no division between the cast and the crew on this film, and that's what made it so special.  So, to have been surrounded by a remarkable group of people who provided an unbroken chain of support, from David Kross to Ralph Fiennes, Bruno Ganz, Lena Olin, from hair and makeup to cinematography, from the art department to the ADs, and from New York to Berlin.  And I'm so lucky to have a wonderful husband and two beautiful children who let me do what I love and who love me just the way that I am.

Anthony [Minghella] and Sydney [Pollack], this is for you.  This is for both of you.  And I want to acknowledge my fellow nominees, these goddesses.  I think we all can't believe we're in a category with Meryl Streep at all.  I'm sorry, Meryl, but you have to just suck that up!  And just to the Academy, thank you so much.  My God!  Thank you!

Documentary, like all filmmaking, is a complete team sport, and I'd like to thank my editor Purcell Carson, cinematographers Nick Doob and Jon Shenk, field producer Nandini Rajwade, and from HBO Sheila Nevins and Lisa Heller.  The same magic that happens in our film happens every day for children with clefts all around the world because of a terrific organization called The Smile Train.  But most importantly for documentary filmmakers it's our subjects:  the incredible Dr. Subodh and his team, Ghutaru Chauhan, and our heroine Pinki Kumari.

Four of them, that I've fallen deeply in love with, I share this night with and I share this award with.  Gabby, I love you so much. You are exquisite.  You are beyond words to me.

Helen, I feel like we are family, through(?) family, and I don't have the words to express just what I think of you.  And Meryl, you know what I think of you, and you are such a good kisser.

I have so many people to thank for my good fortune in this lifetime, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I know.  To the family that allowed me to play them, the Tuohy family.  I know they're in here and you'll probably hear her in a minute... Maybe not. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to the family that made this film, that gave me the opportunity to do something different:  John Lee Hancock, Gil Netter, Alcon, Warner Bros., the actors. Everyone who's shown me kindness when it wasn't fashionable, I thank you.  To everyone who was mean to me when it wasn't... like George Clooney threw me in a pool years ago.  I'm still holding a grudge.

But there's so many people to thank; not enough time.  So I would like to thank what this film was about for me, which are the moms that take care of the babies and the children no matter where they come from.  Those moms and parents never get thanked.  I, in particular, failed to thank one.  So... if I can take this moment to thank Helga B. for not letting me ride in cars with boys till I was eighteen, 'cause she was right; I would've done what she said I was gonna do.  For making me practice every day when I got home, piano, ballet, whatever it is I wanted to be.  She said to be an artist you had to practice every day.  And for reminding her daughters that there's no race, no religion, no class system, no color, nothing, no sexual orientation, that makes us better than anyone else.  We are all deserving of love.  So, to that trailblazer who allowed me to have that, and this [referring to the Oscar], and this, I thank you so much for this opportunity that I share with these extraordinary women, and my lover Meryl Streep.  Thank you.

First, I would like to thank the Academy for showing that it can be about the performance and not the politics.  I want to thank Miss Hattie McDaniel for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to.  Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey, because you touched it the whole world saw it.  Ricky Anderson, our attorney of Anderson & Smith, thank you for your hard work.  My entire BET family, my ""Precious"" family, thank you so much.  To my amazing husband Sidney, thank you for showing me that sometimes you have to forgo doing what's popular in order to do what's right.  And baby, you were so right.  God bless us all.

Wow.  Well, I already have two of these, so I'm feeling greedy.  I'd like to dedicate this one to the costume designers that don't do movies about dead monarchs or glittery musicals.  The designers that do the contemporary films and the low-budget ones that actually don't get as recognized, and they should do and they work as hard.  So this is for you, but I'm gonna take it home tonight.  Thank you.

2009,Directing,The Hurt Locker,Kathryn Bigelow," KATHRYN BIGELOW:
This really is, um, there's no other way to describe it, it's the moment of a lifetime.  First of all, this is so extraordinary to be in the company of such powerful, my fellow nominees, such powerful filmmakers who have inspired me and I have admired for, some of whom, for decades.  And thank you to every member of the Academy.  This is, again, the moment of a lifetime.

I would not be standing here if it wasn't for Mark Boal, who risked his life for the words on the page and wrote such a courageous screenplay.  That I was fortunate enough to have an extraordinary cast bring that screenplay to life in Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty.  And, I think the secret to directing is collaborating and I had truly an extraordinary group of collaborators in my crew:  Barry Ackroyd, and Kalle Júlíusson, and Bob Murawski, Chris Innis, Ray Beckett, Richard Stutsman.  And if I could just also thank my producing partners in Greg Shapiro and Nick Chartier, and my wonderful agent Brian Siberell.  And the people of Jordan, who were such a... so hospitable to us when we were shooting.

And I'd just like to dedicate this to the women and men in the military who risk their lives on a daily basis in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world.  And may they come home safe.  Thank you.

Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you so much to the Academy.  This is insane and I truly, sincerely wish that the prize tonight was to get to work with my fellow nominees.  I'm so in awe of you.  I am so grateful to get to do the job that I do.  I love it so much.  I want to thank my parents, who are right there, first and foremost for giving me my life and for giving me the opportunity to work from such an early age, and showing me every day how to be a good human being by example.

And I want to thank my team who works with me every day.  Aleen Keshishian, my manager for eighteen years.  And my agents, Kevin Huvane and everyone at CAA.  Bryna and Tamar at I/D.  My friends, who are everything to me no matter what's going on in my career.  And everyone who's ever hired me:  Luc Besson, who gave me my first job when I was eleven years old; Mike Nichols, who has been my hero and my champion for the past decade; and now Darren Aronofsky. You are a fearless leader, a visionary.  I am blessed to have just gotten to get to work with you every day for the period of time we did.

So many people helped me prepare for this role.  Mary Helen Bowers spent a year with me, training me.  Michelle Rodriguez, and Kurt Froman, and Olga Kostritzky, Marina Stavitskaya, and my beautiful love, Benjamin Millepied, who choreographed the film and has now given me my most important role of my life. And also there are people on films that no one ever talks about that are your heart and soul every day.  Margie and Geordie, who did my hair and makeup; Nicci, who dressed me; and Kate and Laura Mulleavy, who designed the beautiful ballet costumes.  Joe Reidy, our incredible AD, first AD.  And our camera operators, J.C. and Steve, you gave me so much soul behind the camera every day and you gave me all of your energy.  Most importantly, my family, my friends, and my love.  Thank you so much.

My family, my beautiful son who's traveling right now in South America and can't join me.  It's okay; I'm okay, Jack.  My mom and my dad, and my brother, and my friends, and my family.  And I wanna thank the very most of all, the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences, their board of governors and all their members, whom many of you are here today.

2010,Costume Design,Alice in Wonderland,Colleen Atwood," COLLEEN ATWOOD:
Thank you to the Academy and especially to my fellow nominees who are just so much fun to sit with at the, tonight and have been so supportive.  It's great to be part of such a great group of people.  The story ""Alice in Wonderland"" was described by its publisher in 1865 as a story valued for its rare imagination, priceless humor, and power to transport the reader into a world of pure fantasy; a gift to us all.  The heart of any movie lies with the director and I've been incredibly lucky on this and many films to work with the singular Tim Burton.  Tim's imagination along with the amazing cast – Johnny's incandescent ""Hatter,"" Mia's ""Alice"" for all girls all times, Helena's the fearless, big-headed queen, and our crystalline snowflake princess Anne Hathaway – made my job a delight.  We had the support of a production team headed by Richard Zanuck and Katterli Frauenfelder, supported by Joe Roth, Suzanne and Jen Todd, and Disney, but I couldn't have done it without my team: Christine Cantella and my entire group.  Thank you all very much.

First I'm going to thank Don, because when you thank your husband at the end of the speech they play him out with the music, and I want him to know that everything I value most in our lives you've given me. And now secondly, my other partner. Thirty-seven years ago, my first play in New York City, I met the great hairstylist and makeup artist Roy Helland. And we worked together pretty continuously since the day we clapped eyes on each other. His first film with me was ""Sophie's Choice,"" and all the way up to tonight when he won for his beautiful work in ""The Iron Lady"" thirty years later. Every single movie in between. And I just want to thank Roy, but also I want to thank -- because I really understand I'll never be up here again. I really want to thank all my colleagues, all my friends. I look out here and, you know, I see my life before my eyes: my old friends, my new friends. And really, this is such a great honor, but the thing that counts the most with me is the friendships and the love and the sheer joy we have shared making movies together. My friends, thank you, all of you, departed and here, for this, you know, inexplicably wonderful career. Thank you so much. Thank you.

"
2011,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,None,Oprah Winfrey," OPRAH WINFREY:
I didn't prepare a speech because I just wanted to feel whatever this is. Because Maria is so correct, it's very difficult for me to open myself to receive what people have to offer. And so tonight I came prepared to be open, and I would like to thank the Board of Governors for the opportunity to receive the love, and the Oscar.

I never imagined myself receiving an Oscar, certainly not for doing what I believe is a part of my calling, is a part of my being. It's a part of why I am here. And what I know for sure is the only reason I am here is because Quincy Jones was in a hotel in Chicago in 1985, and was taking a shower, and was there for a lawsuit, that somebody was suing Michael Jackson saying that they were the girl of the song, or whatever. And he saw me on ""A.M. Chicago"" and said, ""I think that's Sofia."" So I would like to thank Quincy Jones, who is in Dubai right now.

But Quincy Jones was a part of a divine manifestation for me. Those of you, anybody here who's ever watched ""The Oprah Show"" has heard me tell the story of how I first watched, first read The New York Times review on a Sunday about ""The Color Purple."" I read the review, because the book review is the first thing I ever look at on The New York Times. And Stedman and I to this day, it's like, ""You want the book review?"" I go, ""You read the front section. I'll read the book review first."" And I read the book review of ""The Color Purple."" And was in my pajamas, put on my coat, in Baltimore, and went to the bookstore and got the book. And from that moment became, literally, drawn to, in some kind of mystical way, to that story. Mainly because the character... The first line of the book is, ""Dear God, I'm fourteen years old..."" And I had lived that life and couldn't imagine that someone was able to put into words what I had already experienced.

And so began this journey that I was able to really understand that God's hand, or power greater than myself, ""the forces,"" as Sidney Poitier calls them, were engaged in leading my life to a plane and a level that I had not even imagined. But I released myself to those forces, and literally said inside myself, ""Thy will be done."" And as a part of that journey, to be here tonight... Maria touched on it but it is really -- Stedman and I talk about this all the time. It's unimaginable if you are not a black, former colored girl, born in Mississippi in 1954, it's impossible for you to even know what this journey has meant. I know Larry Gordon, Mississippi Jew [laughs], almost as rare as I am [laughs], can begin to understand what that means, to be born in 1954 in Mississippi.

When I saw ""The Help,"" and first heard that there was gonna be a movie called ""The Help,"" and first read the book, ""The Help,"" I thought that is my story. My grandmother was a maid. Her mother was a maid. The mother before her was a slave. My mother was a maid. My grandmother's greatest dream for me was that I would grow up in a family and have a career where... She used to say, ""I hope you get some good white folks. I hope you get some good white folks like I have. I have good white folks."" And the only picture I have of my grandmother is of her holding a white child in her maid's uniform. So, the journey from Kosciusko, Mississippi, where nobody ever even imagined it possible that you could be anything other than a maid who had some good white folks, who would give you clothes and would let you take food home on the holidays. It's unimaginable that I would be standing before you, voted by the Board of Governors... It's unimaginable. It's unimaginable. It's unimaginable. It is unimaginable! And so when I say thank you, the thank you comes from a place deeper than even I know, Sharon [Stone]. Even deeper than I know. Because it's not just from me, it's from everybody who made me possible. It's from every shoulder I ever stood on, every bridge I ever crossed, every story that's ever told, every story that ever imagined this day to be possible.

I thank you for this award. And I will... What this means for me is, I woke up this morning, I said, ""What is Oscar? What is a... Oscar...?"" You know, I grew up wanting to be an actress and my father, being a barber and coming from the culture that he came from, said, ""No daughter of mine's going to be laying on some casting couch."" That was his idea of what being an actress meant. And so when the opportunity showed itself to me, to be a part of ""The Color Purple,"" it really is, was divine intervention, just to be a part of being able to share that story. I knew that something special, magical, a door had opened to me. And after that door came ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" and many other doors. But a door opened to me through the magic and majesty of film. The ability to tell stories in such a way that you connect to the heart-space of people, and you connect to the place where people really live, and not just live but where their souls abide, that is what great films do. And to this day, ""The Color Purple"" experience is one of the greatest experiences of my life.

And yes, I'd like to do more films, but to receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award means more to me than any film, any acclaim, even an Oscar. Because what it says is that you all get it. The Board of Governors, you get it. You get that what I've been trying to do and what I've been trying to say all these years is that every single person, Ayanna, and all of you and every person I've spoken to in over fifty thousand interviews of ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" every single person who incarnates here to the planet matters. Your life matters. You matter. What you do matters. The fact that you are here, that you are born, that your presence here on earth means something. That's what I've been trying to say through all of my work, be it film, be it ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" be it the magazine, it is that we all matter. And what I really, really, really, really know for sure, is that this award to me represents all of you, sitting in a room -- I don't know how this happens. The governors, I don't know who you are. But when I got the call from Tom [Sherak] I was literally on a hike in Hawaii, and I get the call. The Academy has called! Security comes for me and says, ""You must come down from the mountain now! Stop the hike because Tom from the Academy is on the phone."" And then Larry Gordon is saying, ""Answer the phone! Answer the phone!"" And I'm like, whaaat...? Okay! What this really means is that you all understand that what I've been trying to do and what I've tried to say all these years, is that all us can make a difference through the life that we live.

And when you understand, as I do, that this to me, I'm gonna allow this Oscar... Like I've interviewed everybody over the years and say, ""Where do you keep your Oscar?"" And people are always so nonchalant about it and they say: ""Oh my, I keep it in my bathroom."" ""I don't know where mine is."" ""My sister has it."" Well my new sister, my sister who I just discovered last year, this time last year, is here. Pat is here. I will say she will not have it; I will have it! And it will be on, I will keep it on my desk in front of me to remind me that you have voted for me. You have voted for what I believe is the essence of why we're all here. We're all here to help each other. We're all here to use our lives in service to one another. And nobody who has ever, ever done any kind of work... I mean I run a girls school and those girls are gonna be graduating from college. The first in their families to ever graduate from college. The first in their families to ever graduate high school. And those girls are coming to the United States and they're going to Wellesley and they're going to Brown and they're going to Tufts and they're going to all the great universities. And I will tell you that anybody who's ever done that, done any kind of work where you are hands on, where you're up on the phone and you're on at four o'clock in the morning and two in the morning and whatever, you're not doing that because you think you're gonna get an Oscar one day. You're doing it because you believe in the power of every human being who has come to this planet. And you know that these are all bodies, but inside the bodies there's a soul and a spirit and a power greater than we know. And for me this Oscar will represent love from all of you. I thank you for your vote of love and I will use it to increase the open space in my heart to continue to do the great and good work that we've all come to do and serve. Thank you so much.

Sit down; you're too old to be standing. Thank you, Mr. Day-Lewis. From you it exacerbates this honor to it and it blows it right out of the ballpark. Thank you so much to the Academy. As random and as subjective as this award is, it means a great deal in a year of extraordinary – yet again – extraordinary performances by women. Amy Adams, everything you do, but your performance in ""American Hustle"" blew my mind. And Meryl, what can I say? Sandra, I could watch that performance to the end of time, and I sort of felt like I had. Julia, #suckit. You know what I mean? And Judi Dench, I mean what a career. She's not here tonight because at the age of 79 her film was so successful that she's in India doing a sequel. I mean what a career that is, if I could hope.

And me, I'm here accepting an award in an extraordinary screenplay by Woody Allen. Thank you so much, Woody, for casting me. I truly appreciate it. I'm so very proud that ""Blue Jasmine"" stayed in the cinemas for as long as it did. And thank you to Sony Classics, to Michael and Tom, for their extraordinary support, for so bravely and intelligently distributing the film. And to the audiences who went to see it, and perhaps those of us in the industry who are still foolishly clinging to the idea that female films with women at the center are niche experiences. They are not. Audiences want to see them and, in fact, they earn money. So... The world is round, people!

Thank you to my mum, to my sister, to my brother, to my three glorious sons; I would not be standing here without you. To my husband Andrew, you are a legend. Thank you to my agent Hylda Queally; you're behind the pillar somewhere up there. You are a goddess. To my agent in Australia, Robyn Gardiner, I love you so very much. To my publicist Lisa Kasteler. To the sublime Sally Hawkins and to the extraordinary cast of ""Blue Jasmine,"" I don't know how to do this without other actors and this I share with you. To the hair and makeup people who sweated me up and tried to make me look attractive, thank you for the attempt. To Carla Meyer, for getting Sally and I together and for incredible support. To Helen Robin. To everyone involved in ""Blue Jasmine,"" I thank you so much.

And finally, I would like to thank every single member of the Sydney Theatre Company, one of the great theater companies in the world. For me working on ""Blue Jasmine,"" it was a real synthesis of my work in the theater and on film. And not only working with you for the last six years has been the most enormous privilege of my career, but it's made me a better actress.

Thank you so much. I read an article that said that winning an Oscar could lead to living five years longer. If that's true, I'd really like to thank the Academy because my husband is younger than me. There's no such thing as best actress, as is evidenced by the performances of my fellow nominees. I've been honored to be among you every step of the way. I am grateful for this and grateful for the opportunity to stand up here and thank people that I love. My manager Evelyn O'Neill, Kevin Huvane, Steven Huvane, Josh Lieberman. My family: my grandparents, my brother Peter, my sister Valerie, my mother and father who told me that I could be whatever I wanted to be if I got an education. Although I didn't think they meant being an actress. And I thank my dad for showing me the world.

I want to thank everybody who made this movie: Sony Classics, Killer Films, James Brown, Lex Lutzus, Lisa Genova, Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin. I'm so happy, I'm thrilled, actually, that we were able to hopefully shine a light on Alzheimer's disease. So many people with this disease feel isolated and marginalized, and one of the wonderful things about movies is it makes us feel seen and not alone. And people with Alzheimer's deserve to be seen, so that we can find a cure. And finally, to our filmmakers, Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, who had hoped to be here tonight but they can't because of Richard's health. When Richard was diagnosed with ALS, Wash asked him what he wanted to do. Did he want to travel? Did he want to see the world? And he said that he wanted to make movies, and that's what he did. And finally, for my husband Bart and our children, Cal and Liv, thank you for my life, thank you for giving me a home. Thank you very much for this.

What another lovely day. Very quickly, if Iain Smith, our amazing executive producer from Scotland, hadn't sent me a text saying, ""whatcha doing at the moment?"" and then got me on a plane out to meet George Miller and Doug Mitchell, I wouldn't obviously be standing here. It was a year of our lives in the Namibian desert. We had the most amazing crew. I hope that some, I'd heard they were on ticker tape, I thought they'd, that the names were going on the screen. But honestly, if anybody wants to know more about any of them just get in touch with me through my wonderful agents Wayne Fitterman from William Morris and Sue Latimer from ARG. But it was an incredible experience. But I just want to say one quite serious thing and I've been thinking about this a lot. But actually it could be horribly prophetic, ""Mad Max,"" if we're not kinder to each other and if we don't stop polluting our atmosphere. So you know, it could happen.

Thank god I have two of them now [laughs]. This is what happens when determined women get together. From Saba, the woman in my film who remarkably survived an honor killing and shared her story, to Sheila Nevins and Lisa Heller from HBO, to Tina Brown, who supported me from day one. To the men who champion women, like Geof Bartz in my film, who's edited the film, to Asad Faruqi, to my friend Ziad, who brought this film to the government. To all the brave men out there, like my father and my husband, who push women to go to school and work and who want a more just society for women. Last week – this week the Pakistani Prime Minister has said that he will change the law on honor killing after watching this film. That is the power of film.

Wow. Charlize! [Waves to her in the audience.] Us Mad Maxers are doing okay tonight. Thank you so much to the Academy. You know, ""Mad Max"" was the best-reviewed film of 2015. Audiences loved it, and to be honored tonight is just more than we could ever have hoped for. But, it took enormous creative courage and guts to make this film, so I just want to say thanks to George Miller, Doug Mitchell and the whole crew that endured six months in that Namibian desert to bring back the most amazing footage. But honestly, it's in the edit room that the final, that the film is finally forged. It's the final rewrite. So I just want to salute my beloved picture department who are in Sydney, and all who work in post, who work with their hands, heads and most importantly, their hearts. Thank you.

Thank you so much to the Academy. To the women in this category – Natalie, Isabelle, Meryl, Ruth – you were all so extraordinary, and I look up to you and I admire you more than I can put into words. It has been the greatest honor just to stand alongside you; that is the greatest honor of all. To my mom and my dad and my brother Spencer and my soul sister Chrissy* and my whole family, I love you so much. Thank you for everything. And to Doug Wald, who stood by me all these years, and to Holly and Michelle and Craig and P.J. and Greta and Bob Cooper, thank you so much. And I realize that a moment like this is a huge confluence of luck and opportunity and so I want to thank Damien Chazelle for the opportunity to be part of a project that was so special and once in a lifetime. I'm so grateful to have been involved in this film. And thank you for your faith and your patience and such a wonderful experience. And Ryan Gosling, thank you for making me laugh and for always raising the bar and for being the greatest partner on this crazy adventure. To our whole crew, everyone that put their heart and souls into this film, I'm gonna find you all individually and I'm gonna thank you, along with my friends who I love so much, I am gonna hug the hell out of you when the feeling reenters my body. I still have a lot of growing and learning and work to do, and this guy is a really beautiful symbol to continue on that journey and I am so grateful for that. So thank you so much. Thank you.

2016,Actress in a Supporting Role,Fences,Viola Davis," VIOLA DAVIS:
Thank you to the Academy. You know, there's one place that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered. One place. And that's the graveyard. People ask me all the time, ""What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?"" And I say, exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories. The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition. People who fell in love and lost. I became an artist, and thank god I did, because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life. So here's to August Wilson, who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.

And to Bron Pictures, Paramount, MACRO, Todd Black, Molly Allen, Scott Rudin for being the cheerleaders for a movie that is about people, and words, and life, and forgiveness and grace. And to Mykelti Williamson, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Russell Hornsby, Jovan Adepo, Saniyya Sidney, for being the most wonderful artists I've ever worked with. And, ""O captain, my captain,"" Denzel Washington. Thank you for puttin' two entities in the driving seat: August and God. And they served you well.

And to Dan and Mae Alice Davis, who were the, and are the center of my universe. The people who taught me, good or bad, how to fail, how to love, how to hold an award, how to lose. My parents. I'm so thankful that God chose you to bring me into this world. To my sisters. My sister Deloris, who's here, who played Jaji and Jaja with me. We were rich white women in the tea party games. Thank you for the imagination. And to my husband and my daughter, my heart, you and Genesis. You teach me every day how to live, how to love. I'm so glad that you are the foundation of my life. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you.

Thank you to Warner Bros. for their tremendous, really supportive team. Steve Papazian. My amazing director, lovely David Yates. It's just like a special treat to work with him.

2017,Actress in a Leading Role,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri",Frances McDormand,"FRANCES McDORMAND:
Okay. So I'm hyperventilating a little bit. If I fall over pick me up because I've got some things to say. So I think this is what Chloe Kim must have felt like after doing back-to-back 1080s in the Olympic halfpipe. Did you see that? Okay, that's what it feels like.

I want to thank Martin McDonagh; look what you did. We are a bunch of hooligans and anarchists but we do clean up nice. I want to thank every single person in this building. And my sister Dorothy. I love you, Dot. And I especially want to thank my clan, Joel and Pedro ""McCoen."" These two stalwart individuals were well-raised by their feminist mothers. They value themselves, each other, and those around them. I know you are proud of me and that fills me with everlasting joy.

And now, I want to get some perspective. If I may be so honored to have all the female nominees in every category stand with me in this room tonight. The actors—Meryl, if you do it everybody else will, c'mon. The filmmakers. The producers. The directors. The writers. The cinematographer. The composers. The songwriters. The designers. C'mon! Okay. Look around, everybody. Look around, ladies and gentlemen, because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed. Don't talk to us about it at the parties tonight. Invite us into your office in a couple days—or you can come to ours, whichever suits you best—and we'll tell you all about them. I have two words to leave with you tonight, ladies and gentlemen: inclusion rider."
2018,Actress in a Leading Role,The Favourite,Olivia Colman,"OLIVIA COLMAN:
It's genuinely quite stressful. This is hilarious; got an Oscar. Okay. I have to thank lots of people. If, by the way, I forget anybody I'm gonna find you later and I'm gonna give you all a massive snog, and I'm really sorry if I might forget now. Yorgos, my best director, in the best film, and with Emily and Rachel, the two loveliest women in the world to fall in love with and to go to work with every day. I mean, you can imagine, it wasn't a hardship. And to be in this category with these extraordinary women. And Glenn Close, you've been my idol for so long and this is not how I wanted it to be. And I think you're amazing and I love you very much. I love you all.

Thank you, Lindy King, my agent who took me on over twenty years ago. Thank you sooo much. And Olive, and Hildy, and Bryna, who made me do things that I've said no to but she was right. And my mum and my dad — well, you know. And my kids who are at home and watching, look! Well, if you're not then, well kind of well done, but I sort of hope you are. This is not gonna happen again.

And any little girl who is practicing their speech on the telly, you never know. And when I used to work as a cleaner, and I loved that job, I did spend quite a lot of my time imagining this — oh, please wrap up. Right, okay. [Sticks her tongue out and blows a raspberry.] Thank you. And my husband Ed, my best friend, I love you so much. Twenty-five years and you've been my best supporter, and he's gonna cry. I'm not. And thank you so much. Fox, everybody, everybody, the cast, the crew. Frances, Sam, thank you. Thank you so much [blows a kiss], Lady Gaga. [Lady Gaga blows kisses back.] And Melissa. Thank you."
2018,Actress in a Supporting Role,If Beale Street Could Talk,Regina King,"REGINA KING:
To be standing here representing one of the greatest artists of our time, James Baldwin, it's a little surreal. James Baldwin birthed this baby and Barry, you nurtured her, you surrounded her with so much love and support. So it's appropriate for me to be standing here, 'cause I'm an example of what it looks like when support and love is poured into someone. Mom, I love you so much. Thank you for teaching me that God is always leaning, always has been leaning, in my direction. G'moses(?). They'll ask me about that later. Um, so many people to thank. Chelsea Barnard, who brought this project to Annapurna. Megan Ellison. Annapurna. Plan B. This amazing cast. My sisters in art: Marina, Amy, Emma, Rachel. Has been an honor having my name be just said with yours this whole step of the way. It's been pretty amazing. The Rivers family: KiKi, Colman, Teyonah, Stephan. God is good all the time."

Thank you to the Academy for this honor. Just to be in this room with such remarkable artists, including my fellow nominees, my sisters and colleagues.

Thank you, Noah, for your words and for your friendship in art and life with you and Greta. Thank you to this cast: the majestic Adam, Scarlett, Alan, Ray. Our amazing crew, David.

Noah wrote a movie about love and about breaching divisions in the name and in the honor of family and home, and hopefully for all of us, in the name of our planet. And I would like to say a special thank you to the gifts of the love stories in my life: my stepchildren C.J. and Harris, my heart and inspiration, Ellery and Jaya. And you know, some say never meet your heroes, but I say if you're really blessed you get them as your parents. I share this with my acting heroes, my legends: Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern.

Oh, man. Thank you. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you to my brilliant, brilliant nominees, fellow nominees, thank you. My entire ""Nomadland"" company, what a crazy once-in-a-lifetime journey we went on together. Thank you so much. I'm so grateful to you.

I've been thinking a lot lately of how I keep going when things get hard. And I think, I think it goes back to something I learned when I was a kid. When I was growing up in China my dad and I used to play this game. We would memorize classic Chinese poems and texts, and we would recite it together and try to finish each other's sentences. And there's one that I remember so dearly. It's called the ""Three Character Classics."" And the first phrase goes: rén zhi chu, xìng ben shàn. ""People at birth are inherently good."" And those six letters had such a great impact on me when I was a kid, and I still truly believe them today. Even though sometimes it might seem like the opposite is true, but I have always found goodness in the people I've met, everywhere I went in the world. So this [holding up the Oscar] is for anyone who has the faith and the courage to hold on to the goodness in themselves, and to hold on to the goodness in each other, no matter how difficult it is to do that. And this is for you. You inspire me to keep going. Thank you. Thank you."
2020,Writing (Original Screenplay),PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN,Emerald Fennell,"EMERALD FENNELL:
Oh my gosh. They said write a speech and I didn't 'cause I just didn't think this would ever happen. And I'm going to be in trouble with Steven Soderbergh. I'm so sorry. I don't want him to be cross with me. Oh my god, he's so heavy [referring to the Oscar statuette], and he's so cold! I better lay him down. So the only speech I ever wrote was when I was ten. And I had a look to see if there'd be anything useful from it, but unfortunately it mostly thanked Zack Morris from ""Saved by the Bell,"" who was my very supportive husband. Unfortunately, he hasn't been as much a part of my life as I'd hoped, and so that speech is not that useful.

But all I can say is – I'm trying very hard not to cry, which is very difficult as an English person because you don't cry ever. This film was made by the most incredible people in the world, who made it in 23 days, just, and brought their complete genius and love and humor to it. And I have so many people to thank. I feel mortified that I'm here by myself when it's not just my job at all. I want to thank Carey Mulligan for being not only the most talented person in the world, but the kindest and the funniest. I want to thank the producers for standing behind this film always and, you know, never giving up. And LuckyChap, Focus, FilmNation. The cast and the crew, the greatest in the world, the kindest in the world. They just made me look good, and again, I'm just so grateful. Finally, my family: Mum, Dad, Coco, my husband Chris – come on, come on – our son, who did not arrive until a couple of weeks after shooting. Thank god, because I was crossing my legs the whole way through. So thank you all so much. Steven, I hope that was alright. Thank you."
2021,Costume Design,Cruella,Jenny Beavan,"JENNY BEAVAN:
[Holding up the Oscar:] Team ""Cruella."" Go team ""Cruella."" Now if you heard the really embarrassing noises it was probably my family who are somewhere up there, who supported me through this extraordinary experience. Which had massive amounts of fun, as you can see, but also, it was slightly stressful. The only one I'm missing is my darling son-in-law David, who used to give me good advice at the end of every day but is no longer with us. Anyway, [looking down at her outfit] I just thought I should explain -- it obviously didn't go down well last time. This is honoring my inner Cruella: a little bit of Maddy Moxham, Random Lapel, Tom Davies eyewear, Thom Botwood graffiti.

And I have to tell you when Kristin Burr and Craig Gillespie asked me to do this movie, I truly didn't think we had the time. I mean, I actually nearly said no. Glad I didn't. The only reason I didn't was because Clare Spragge -- who's sitting just there, sparkling -- said she would come on board as costume supervisor and bring the team. The team of the most phenomenal, creative, clever, generous, amazing people, I mean, without whom obviously it wouldn't have happened. And I also need to thank Nadia and Naomi and Julia, our makeup and hair team, because they complete the looks. I mean, you know, it would be a little sad putting a Cruella costume in my hair. But also, the actors who just brought such life. I think Emma Thompson hyperventilating over some of her fittings with joy was one of the highlights of my career.

Anyway, I think that's all. [Paging through her show program:] I kind of, of course left the thing in the car and had to write it all on here. But I think I've probably -- people have made such wonderful speeches. But the lovely thing I think about a film like ""Cruella"" is it does bring a bit of fun and joy in these terrible times, which others have mentioned. [Music begins to play.] But, you know, it -- it was great to do. And thank you, Academy. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
2021,Directing,The Power of the Dog,Jane Campion,"JANE CAMPION:
Thank you, Kevin, that was very dramatic. Just want to say, big love to my fellow nominees. I love you all. You're all so extraordinarily talented, and it could have been any of you.

Kia ora, kia ora, Aotearoa, New Zealand and Australia. I love directing because it's a deep dive into story, yet the task of manifesting a world can be overwhelming. The sweet thing is I'm not alone. On ""The Power of the Dog"" I worked with actors I'm moved to call my friends. They met the challenge of the story with the depth of their gifts: Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Jesse Plemons. And my whole crew, who are true hearts. I thank my brilliant producers. Tanya Seghatchian, who was always by my side. Emile Sherman, Iain Canning and Roger Frappier. Also, Kate Richter. Netflix, your whole awesome team embraced this film from the very beginning, thank you so very much.

And my home people, my family, you know who you are. Especially Alice, my daughter, is here. Toni, my beautiful partner, you gave me so much love and encouragement and made it fun. But it would be impossible without the man I never met, Thomas Savage. He wrote about cruelty wanting the opposite, kindness. Thank you, Academy. It's a lifetime honor. Thank you."
2022,Writing (Adapted Screenplay),WOMEN TALKING,Sarah Polley,"SARAH POLLEY:
Thank you. First of all, I just want to thank the Academy for not being mortally offended by the words ""women"" and ""talking"" put so close together like that. Cheers. Miriam Toews wrote an essential novel about a radical act of democracy in which people who don't agree on every single issue manage to sit together in a room and carve out a way forward together, free of violence. They do so not just by talking but also by listening. The last line of our film is delivered by a young woman to a new baby, and she says: ""Your story will be different from ours."" It's a promise, a commitment, and an anchor. And it's what I would like to say with all of my might to my three incredible kids, Eve, Isla, and Amy, as they make their way through this complicated, beautiful world. Thank you to the best man I've ever known, David Sandomierski, for giving me the optimism to believe we can and will do better. Dede Gardner and Frances McDormand, thank you for letting me stand on your shoulders and making this space for me. We have the most incredible cast and the most incredible crew, some of whom are here tonight -- please, stand up if you're there [pointing] or in the nosebleeds, and everybody at home who worked on this film. Oh my god! I accept this on all of our behalf. Thank you. Thank you. Wow!"
