"
1964,Sound Effects,Norman Wanstall," NORMAN WANSTALL:
Ladies and gentlemen, it's very difficult to say thank you as sincerely as I'd like to now, but I'm a technician so maybe I can leave the eloquence to the artists that follow. But on behalf of the sound departments that I've worked with and my production company and myself, may I thank you all very sincerely for this tremendous honor. And once more may I thank you for the opportunity of coming to your wonderful country. I think for my wife and I this trip is going to be the greatest experience of our lives. Thank you very much indeed.

Don't let anybody tell you this isn't a terrific thrill.  There are so many people always, and in this case it's very much the same.  Firstly, I'd to thank Hal Prince who started it all.  Next, Martin Baum, Manny Wolf and Cy Feuer.  Bob Fosse, whose gift is enormous and helped me so much.  The other players, among them Liza, Michael, Marisa.

Thank you very much.
"
1974,Documentary (Feature),"Peter Davis and Bert Schneider, Producers"," PETER DAVIS:
Thank you so much.  It's ironic, of course, to get a prize for a war movie while the suffering in Vietnam continues.  But I feel very lucky that we have it and even luckier in our colleagues in filming, Dick Pearce, Tom Cohen and Brennon Jones, and in editing, Lynzee Klingman and Susan Martin, who deserve the award equally with Bert and me.  Mostly, though, I have been blessed, and not just lucky, with the support and inspiration of my wife Johanna and with the patience of our sons who I hope will grow up in a country and atmosphere somewhat different from the one we had to portray in ""Hearts and Minds.""  And who I hope will go to bed now.  Thank you.

BERT SCHNEIDER:
First of all, I would like to say a special thank you to my late brother Stanley whose support and love and encouragement allowed us to make this film and all of the films that BBS made.  It is ironic that we are here at a time just before Vietnam is about to be liberated.  I will now read a short wire that I have been asked to read by the Vietnamese people.  It is sent by Ambassador Dinh Ba Thi, who is the chief of the Provisional Revolutionary Government's delegation to Paris, the Paris political talks.  It says: ""Please transmit to all our friends in America our recognition of all that they have done on behalf of peace and for the application of the Paris Accords on Vietnam.  These actions serve the legitimate interest of the American people and the Vietnamese people.  Greetings of friendship to all the American people.""  Thank you very much.

AL KASHA:
To the great inspiration in my life, my wife Ceil Kasha.  I'm very nervous as you can see.  And I'd like to thank the members of the Academy.  And part of this is owed to Irwin Allen, and Lionel Newman, and Jere Henshaw, and Happy Goday, and to the public and to all the members of the Academy.  And thank you, Gene.

I loved writing this movie and it seems redundant to me to receive an award when the only award I ever wanted was a chance to write a script like this. May I share this honor with my wife Mab Ashforth and my friend and agent, Arnold Stiefel.  Thank you, members of the Academy.

PAUL WILLIAMS:
I was gonna thank all the little people and... then I remembered I am the little people.  [Speaking to audience member:] You're right, Hank, it's very heavy.  This is a very nice thing.  When you wish upon a star, it's a beautiful thing to have happen.  I, you know, a lot of us worked on ""A Star Is Born.""  ""Evergreen"" had a beautiful arrangement by Ian Freebairn-Smith, and a guy that I work with named Kenny Ascher was involved.  There're a lot of us. I wish that I could share all of this with them right now.  I know they're watching, and I say to them and to Denny Bond and my wife Katie:  I love you. God bless you.  Thank you, Academy.

[Responding to opening comments made by presenter Norman Mailer:]  In the name of all us perverts.

I don't as a rule, in fact I don't ever before remember making public acknowledgment of private and very personal feelings, but I think it's time that I acknowledge two people whom I can never really thank properly or enough.  I would like to thank my wife Sue and my son Dan for their indestructible support and enthusiasm, for their ideas, their discussions, their stimulation and for their very presence:  my gratitude and my love. Thank you.

It feels very good to be honored by such a prestigious organization as the Academy of Motion Picture.  All our gratitude goes to the membership.  Karl Hess is not here tonight but he deserves a good chunk of the Oscar that we won.  He was such a good performer.  His ideas on how [to] take control of one's life I think can map our route toward liberty, and liberty is all this country's about.  And I'm proud, you know, to have bring ""Karl Hess"" with my partner.  And I would like to say just one more word to my folks in Quebec City:  Je vous invite à partager avec moi la joie de reçevoir ce grand honneur ce soir.  Thank you very much.

1982,Honorary Award,"To Mickey Rooney, in recognition of his 60 years of versatility in a variety of memorable film performances."," MICKEY ROONEY:
Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Academy, this is for sixty years of work, so they tell me.  It's really only for six minutes of fun, of love and joy, of working with, playing with, like children, the people that we all are on the screen.  I love every minute that God has given me to be an infinitesimal small part of this great business.  Sixty years, gosh, I... Tonight for my being here, and the responsibility really belongs to somebody that I'd love to put my arms around, like Judy Garland, and Lewis Stone, Fay Holden, Spencer Tracy, Wallace Beery.  Memories, I have a lot of memories, as we all do.

When I was nineteen years old I was the number one star of the world, for two years.  When I was forty, nobody wanted me.  I couldn't get a job.  And then a professor from the University of Tennessee got a show together with Terry Allen Kramer and Harry Rigby called ""Sugar Babies,"" and it resurrected my career.  Last year God smiled upon me and I was given the Emmy for ""Bill,"" and I won the Peabody Award and the Golden Globe, and tonight you honor me beyond anything that a man should be given.  You honor me with the greatest and the highest tribute we can receive in our business.

My family all love you and they're all tingling inside because of this moment for me.  I'd love to even kiss Louis B. Mayer.  But it's, it's wonderful.  The woman who put it all together was Ruth Webb, my agent, who picked up the pieces and put 'em back together.  Mickey, Jr., Timmy, Teddy, Kelly, Kerry, Kyle, Kimmy Sue, Jimmy, Jonell, Chris and Mark, and my grandchildren, my grandchildren Shannon and Nika*.  They're home tonight looking and saying, ""That's Granddaddy up there, and he's got the Oscar.""  But the one that's responsible, outside of God, is my wife Jan, who kept saying to me for the last seven years, ""I know you can do it, Mick.  Get up off the canvas.  You can do it.""  I want to thank you, one and all, for remembering me.  Thank you for this glorious moment.  God bless and good night.

And before I give the microphone to my colleagues, I would like to say that we do thank our assistant editors and apprentice editors for their marvelous, dedicated support all through the project, who kept their sense of humor and carried us through to the end.

LISA FRUCHTMAN:
""The Right Stuff"" required a monumental effort on the part of a lot of people, not all of whom we can thank tonight, but I'd like to just add to those already mentioned our producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler, who were the first to see the possibilities for a terrific movie in Tom Wolfe's book.  And again, our director Phil Kaufman, who transformed that book into a fantastic script and then into a fantastic movie from which we were able to work with terrific footage and whose vision carried us throughout the editing. For myself, I'd like to just thank my husband for his unwavering support during a difficult year and a half, and my colleagues Francis Coppola, Walter Murch and Bill Reynolds, without whose support and inspiration I wouldn't be here tonight.  Thank you.

1985,Directing,Sydney Pollack," SYDNEY POLLACK:
Thank you very much.  Frank Price made this film possible.  He had the courage when it mattered the most and was easy to say no.  I knew it was impossible to get a screenplay from this material so I didn't try; Kurt Luedtke didn't know it was impossible and so he did it.  David Rayfiel kept us honest.  Meryl, Bob, Klaus and Malick brought those characters to life and made an incredible world.  All of us being helped all the time by Terry Clegg who kept us going.  I had a team of editors who locked themselves in a room with me seven days a week, twelve hours a day and behaved as though nothing else in the world existed.  John Barry made it all sing.  Karen Blixen lived that life and turned it into art and taught a generation a new way to write prose.  My wife Claire gave me more encouragement than I have any right to have, put up with more, was more tolerant.  I'm indebted to all of them.  I can't leave this podium without saying, I could not have made this film without Meryl Streep.  She is astounding personally, professionally, in all ways, and I can't thank her enough.  Thank you.
"

My wife Laurie, members of the Academy, I thank you very much.

This is great.  I'm a little nervous.  I would like to thank the Academy. Everyone at Industrial Light & Magic who worked so hard on this show, including Bill Kimberlin, Laurie Vermont, Ray Gilberti, the entire animation department, my wife Robin.  I'd also like to thank Greg Cannom, who did the makeups.  James Horner, who did the great film score that made our work look twice as good as it was.  Richard Zanuck, David Brown, Lili Fini Zanuck.  And of course, the man that I think in the future, the very near future, that will be up here as a recipient, Ron Howard.  Thank you.

RALPH McQUARRIE:
I'd just like to thank Dick and Lili for having me on the show.  And to the guys at ILM that really took an interest in the sketches that I made.  Thank you.

SCOTT FARRAR:
This is a great picture to be involved with.  I want to thank Robert Hill, Steve Gawley, the entire company at ILM.  My wife Mary, Katherine and Maggie. And especially George Lucas who started ILM in the first place.  Thank you.

"
1986,Directing,Oliver Stone," OLIVER STONE:
Thank you.  Thank you for this ""Cinderella"" ending.  But I think that through this award you're really acknowledging the Vietnam veteran.  And I think what you're saying is that for the first time, you really understand what happened over there.  And I think what you're saying is that it should never, ever in our lifetimes happen again.  And if it does, then those American boys died over there for nothing, because America learned nothing from the Vietnam War.

My special thanks go to my cast and crew.  To Tom and Charlie and Willem.  To Bob Richardson, Claire Simpson, Bruno Rubeo, the rest of you.  My producers: Arnold Kopelson, Derek Gibson, Alex Ho.  To Captain Dale Dye, who gave his heart and soul for the movie.  To Marion Billings, Andrea Jaffe, Paula Wagner, Mike Mitchell and Bob Marshall.  And to Mr. John Daly, who gave me a shot when nobody else would.  And to my wife Elizabeth, whose deep abiding love got me through the despair.  Thank you.

1986,Best Picture,"Arnold Kopelson, Producer"," ARNOLD KOPELSON:
Thank you very much.  I am deeply grateful.  My profound thanks to John Daly and Derek Gibson for sharing my passion for this property and giving me the money to make it when all others passed.  And thanks also to Gerald Green and Orion Pictures and Vestron Video and Garth Drabinsky for their support.  And Richard Soames, for the completion guarantee.  And Frans Afman of Credit Lyonnais, for having the money in the Philippine jungle when I really needed it.  And to some other people [pulling out his notes]...Arthur Manson, and Marion Billings, and Andrea Jaffe.  And to my wife Anne, who has been my business partner for sixteen years and has been with me every step of the way. And to our children, Peter, Evan and Stephanie, for urging me to make ""Platoon"" because their generation wanted to know more.  And to Dale Dye and the entire cast and crew of ""Platoon,"" for their dedication.  And particularly Oliver Stone, for his brilliance.  I would not be here tonight but for Oliver Stone's brilliance, and I thank you, Oliver.

The power of the motion picture medium is awesome.  ""Platoon"" has brought to this generation a new perspective of war:  That war is not glamorous, that it maims and it kills.  And if perhaps ""Platoon"" could also influence people in this and other countries of the world to hesitate before they engage in war, to demand facts and ask questions before the bombs, then we, not just those of us that made ""Platoon"" but the entire motion picture industry, will have succeeded beyond our wildest imagination.  Thank you so very much.  I will treasure this [holding up his Oscar] forever.
"
1987,Actor in a Leading Role,Michael Douglas," MICHAEL DOUGLAS:
Thank you.  Thank you all very much.  I really want to thank the actors branch of the Academy first, for just being a nominee with four actors that I really admire, and at least one that I consider a really good friend who I admire.  And thank you for that.  And for this fellow [the Oscar] from all of the Academy, I just want to share it with all the good work that was done by all the branches, whether you were nominated or not tonight, but this is all with you.

A large part of this award belongs to Oliver Stone.  And not only as the director, but having the courage to cast me in a part that not many people thought I could play.  So I'll always be eternally grateful to him for that. And as a writer, Oliver, with Stanley Weiser, wrote a part that was the best part that I've ever had in my career.  To Charlie and Martin Sheen, two wonderful actors that happen to be father and son, I thank them all very much for their help.  Ed Pressman, Alex Ho, our producers; Leonard Goldberg, Scott Rudin, Tom Sherak of Fox, I thank you, too.

I'd like to dedicate this award to William Darrid, Diana Douglas-Darrid, Anne Douglas and Kirk Douglas, my parents and step-parents, who have been extremely supportive and loving to me over the years.  And in particular to my father, who I don't think ever missed one of my college productions, for his continued support and for helping a son step out of his shadow.  I'll be eternally grateful to you, Dad, for that.  Finally, to my wife Diandra and all my old friends who are smiling with me tonight, thank you.  And to all you movie buffs, I just really appreciate, for making this a wonderful moment for me. Thank you.  And good night, Cameron.  I love you.

1987,Actor in a Supporting Role,Sean Connery," SEAN CONNERY:
Good evening.  Ladies and gentlemen, friends and a few enemies...I don't think there is anyone aware—or unaware, rather—in Hollywood or the rest of the world tonight that this is the 60th anniversary of these Academy Awards.  And I just realized myself the other day that my first, one and only attendance was thirty years ago.  Patience truly is a virtue.  But in winning this award it creates a certain dilemma, because I had decided if I had the good fortune to win that I would give it to my wife, who deserves it.  But this evening I discovered  backstage that they're worth fifteen thousand dollars...and now I'm not so sure.  Cherie, I'm only kidding, it's yours.  But if such a thing as a wish accompanied this award mine would be that we ended the writers' strike.  And I thank you all sincerely.

Kevin Peter Hall, not only for his brilliant performance, but for his cooperation and for being seven feet tall.

I'd like to thank everybody who ever punched or kissed me in my life and everybody who I ever punched or kissed.  I'd like to thank Norman Jewison especially, because I would not be here if it was not for that man.  I'd like to thank the multi-media princess Cher, and the remarkable Nic Cage, and the ensemble cast of ""Moonstruck"" which was great. I'd like to thank my agent Jeannine Edmunds.  I'd like to thank my wife Jayne for the love that she gives me.  And I'd like to thank Patrick Palmer for producing the picture and Bonnie Palef for associate producing the picture.

1988,Actor in a Supporting Role,Kevin Kline," KEVIN KLINE:
There's a lot of Brits here tonight.  It's scary.  But I have to thank a few of them.  This is astonishing.  A thank you to Michael Shamberg, the producer of ""A Fish Called Wanda,"" who got me together, oh, six or seven years ago with John Cleese, and he said, ""I want to write a movie where you get run over by a steamroller and eat of a lot of Michael Palin's tropical fish.""  I said, ""Great, sounds good.  I'm in.  Let's do it.""  And then he actually wrote it.

I'd like to thank the Academy for naming me in this group of most distinguished actors, the five nominees.  I share this with you.  I would like to thank John Cleese for writing this brilliant script, for his generosity, for his friendship.  To my fellow actors, Michael Palin, Jamie Lee Curtis.  To Jonathan Benson.  To Charlie Crichton, who at seventy-seven proves that even with twenty or twenty-five years off there's no such thing as growing old when you've got a dream.  He's the best.  Thank you very much for this.  And I'd like to thank my wife Phoebe.  Thanks.

1988,Directing,Barry Levinson," BARRY LEVINSON:

I have to tell you, I'm so—I'm so shook up.  I'm so taken by the response to ""Rain Man"" and that we've had such a positive effect on the audiences that have seen the movie.  I'm really appreciative.  I thank all you people from the Academy.  We have a wonderful staff that did a lot of work on autism.  We tried to be as faithful as we could and in the same time try to be entertaining.  I have to thank Michael Ovitz who worked to keep this movie alive when we were, a lot of times when it may not have ever happened.  And I have to thank my wife Diana who, when I walked into the bedroom, when I said, ""I can do 'Rain Man,'"" and she was seven months pregnant.  I said, ""What do you want to do?""  And she said, ""Let's go on the road and do the movie and have the baby wherever we're traveling to.""  We had a little baby boy and I thank her for that.  And I thank you for this [holding up the Oscar].

I've been told for the past five weeks that maybe I should prepare for this, and I can't be prepared for this moment.  There are so many people.  ""Rain Man"" belongs to a lot of people.  Let me start with Ron Bass and Barry Morrow, who wrote a wonderful script.  Peter Guber and Jon Peters, for being exactly what executive producers should be in supporting us all the way.  To Gail Mutrux, for supporting me.  I'd like to thank—boy, Michael Ovitz and Rosalie Swedlin for standing by this for weeks and years.  I'd like to thank Dustin and Tom.  And a wonderful studio that really doesn't exist anymore:  Lee Rich, Tony Thomopoulos and Roger Birnbaum who were United Artists, and really exactly what anybody could want out of a studio.  And the producer [of the Awards telecast] says that we're not allowed to, we shouldn't really thank our families.  We're supposed to wait until we go backstage and use the pay phone. But he doesn't know my family.  I'd like to thank my wife Lezlie, who really stood by me.  Our two foster children, Jack and Rebecca.  And, boy, if I didn't mention my mother I'd be a dead man:  Dorothy King in Great Barrington. Thank you.

LOUIS L. EDEMANN:
I remember the first time Chuck and I screened ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit.""  It was a maze of pencil tests, actors acting with no one, sometimes on empty stages.  After the screening Bob Zemeckis turned to us and said, ""Guys, trust us.  We think we know what we're doing.""  Obviously he did.  On behalf of myself, my partner Chuck, and the sound editing crew, I would like to thank Bob Zemeckis, Amblin, Walt Disney Studios for this great opportunity.

And thank all of you for your...what you've just done [standing ovation].  I think I lost what I was going to say because I've never had a moment like this, and I'm much better behind the camera.

It seems strange to receive an award for living your life.  What has ever seemed special to others that I may have done was only a part of my life:  a life I have with my family at home, my life that I have with my family at work.  I love what I do, I really do.  It's great to be in this industry.  My life has been its own reward.  For you to add such a special honor this evening, well, there simply are no words.

My Paramount family, which I've been part of for the last twenty-six years, where they called me Doctor Koch, and my own family.  My wife Ruth, who I love and adore, and without you I'd still be saying to Mervyn LeRoy, ""I'm ready when you are, Mr. LeRoy!”  But I love you.  And my daughter, my lovely daughter Melinda, who anyone would be proud to have for a daughter.  And her Alan, handsome guy.  Howard, Jr., who hopefully will be standing right on this stage one day receiving his Oscar.  And all my grandchildren are here tonight. Now, wait a minute, I can't remember.  Wally, help me with this.  Let's see, there's Wendy and her Tim, Carol, Robby, and Billy the ""Northwestern flash."" There you are, Billy.  My sister Lola—oh, I forgot Emily!  I told you!  Come back, roll it back.  And my granddaughter Emily.  Emily, the most beautiful one in the family.  I'm sorry.  My sister Lola, and before I forget, my secretary Laurie, who rewrote every letter I dictated and made it better. That's true, Laurie, wherever you are.  And you know, there's an old saying that it's more blessed to give than receive.  But tonight, if I may, it's more blessed to receive.  Thank you.  And thank you, Aubrey:  It's steady ole Peddie!

I just want to say that it's very easy for people to trivialize what we do sometimes.  And they do it in ways of saying, ""Well, if it's such a big deal, how come nobody remembers who last year won the Oscar?""  And I've got a real flash for you.  I will never forget what happened here tonight.  My family will never forget what happened here.  My Native American brothers and sisters across the country, especially the Lakota Sioux, will never forget.  People I went to school with will never forget.  ""Dances With Wolves"" won this year, and while it's not as important as the rest of the world situation where it sits, it will always be important to us, and we thank you for this.

1990,Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award,David Brown and Richard D. Zanuck," RICHARD D. ZANUCK:
Thank you, Academy Board of Governors.  This is a very special moment for me. What this award stands for is recognition of the creative role of the producer in our business.  My father had the honor of being the first recipient of this award, and received it again on two other occasions.  He set a standard of filmmaking which I have strived to uphold.  I am very proud of this honor and obviously my thanks go to many people.  The artists who have been part of our films.  David, my partner and dear friend for many years.  My wife and partner, Lili, who has brought so much inspiration into my life.  And to my father, who taught me so much and who gave me such an early opportunity. Thank you very much.

DAVID BROWN:
Thank you, Dick, and thank you, Michael.  What can I add to this extraordinary evening?  ""Thank you"" seems too mild a response to the Academy's governors for this kind of honor.  Frankly, I'm simply overwhelmed.  Simply, I'm frankly overwhelmed!

And yet I must add that I am also grateful to both Zanucks, Darryl and Dick. Darryl brought me to Hollywood, and I had the good fortune and longevity to continue the Zanuck connection through the many years Dick and I shared as partners and close friends.  We intend to continue to justify the accolade the Academy's Governors have bestowed on us and hope to be worthy of the distinguished company in which they have placed us.  Thanks also to you, ladies and gentlemen of the Academy, and to my non-voting, beautiful wife.

I actually, I have friends who have won this before, but -- and I swear -- I have never held one before.  This is the first time I've ever had one of these in my hand.  Oh, dear.

Let me just start by saying that this never could have happened, this never could have gotten started without a survivor named Poldek Pfefferberg who Oskar Schindler saved from Auschwitz, from Belsen.  He's the man who talked Thomas Keneally into writing the book.  I owe him such a debt.  All of us owe him such a debt.  He has carried the story of Oskar Schindler to all of us.  A man of complete obscurity who makes us wish and hope for Oskar Schindlers in all of our lives.

I have to thank, I want to thank Sid Sheinberg for giving me the book.  Thank you, Sid.  I want to thank Steve Zaillian for a screenplay of inordinate restraint.  I have great actors in this movie.  Liam, thank you.  Ralph, thank you.  Ben Kingsley, thank you.  I want to thank my wife, who's here with me tonight, for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row in Krakow, Poland, last winter when things got just too unbearable.

Let me just say there are 350,000 survivors of the Holocaust alive today.  I implore all the educators who are watching this program to please, do not allow the Holocaust to remain a footnote in history. Please teach this in your schools.  There are 350,000 experts who just want to be useful with the remainder of their lives.  Please listen to the words and the echoes and the ghosts, and please teach this in your schools.  Thank you very, very much for this.  Thank you.

Just very quickly, thank you to the Academy, to a brilliant cast, and a marvelous international crew.  To my wife Pat for sharing the magic for the past forty years.

My number was 83317.  I am a Holocaust survivor.  It's a long way from Auschwitz to this stage.  I want to thank everyone who helped me to come so far.  People died in front of me in the camps.  Their last words were: ""Be a witness of my murder. Tell the world how I died.  Remember.""  Together with Gerry, by helping Steven to make this movie I hope I fulfill my obligation to the innocent victims of the Holocaust.  In the name of the six million Jews killed in the Shoah and other Nazi victims, I want to thank everyone for acknowledg[ing] this movie.  Thank you.

And for this tremendous honor I'd like to thank the members of the Academy, everyone at Paramount Pictures, my entire cast and crew for doing a job that amazed me every day and made it an incredible joy to go to work.  To Wendy Finerman, for bringing this project to me and getting it started in the first place. To Steve Starkey, for making sure we got it finished.

I'd like to say thank you to the Academy for this honor.  And it's just so wonderful to be acknowledged with a great group of movies.  Nine years ago I met a very special man who has since taken me on an amazing journey.  There were many people who gave him gifts along the way.  Eric Roth, you gave ""Forrest"" a soul.  Tom Hanks, you gave ""Forrest"" a heart.  And Bob Zemeckis, you gave ""Forrest"" a vision.  Steve Tisch and Steve Starkey, you were great co-parents.  ""Forrest"" was a labor of love to many people:  our wonderful cast and crew, Sherry, Jon, Michelle, John, Barry, Arthur, all the people at Paramount, Winston, Craig, Rand.  To my parents, grandparents, family, thank you for your support.  To my husband Mark Canton, for your love and always saying go make this dream a reality.  My parents always said dreams can come true, and to my own children, Dorothy, Henry and James, if you doubt it, please remember tonight because I always will.  Thank you.

STEVE TISCH:
All over the political map people have been calling ""Forrest"" their own.  But ""Forrest Gump"" isn't about politics or conservative values.  It's about humanity.  It's about respect, tolerance and unconditional love.  And tonight we should all feel proud that we are in a business where we entertain, we educate, and we empower.  I'd like to thank my family, my parents Joan and Bob, love to Jamie and to my two wonderful children, Hilary and Willy, and to my four best friends.  And finally, thanks to all the ""Forrest Gumps"" in the world.

STEVE STARKEY:
Well, I truly want to thank the Academy for making me the final person to thank them tonight.  Now I don't know if it was destiny or if it was chance that brought together the talented cast and extraordinary crew of ""Forrest Gump,"" but maybe as ""Forrest"" said: ""Maybe it was both, maybe both were happening at the same time.""  But in any case, as I look back I can't imagine making this film without any one of them or without the commitment of Sherry Lansing and Paramount Studios.  But most of all, the picture could not have been made without the gentle spirit of Tom Hanks and the guidance and inspiration of the guy we fondly call Bob Z, the truly visionary director Bob Zemeckis.  And I wish to thank them all, and especially my wife Olivia who has stood beside me over the years in everything I've done.  And hello to my parents.  Thank you all very much.

Whoa.  Lord, have mercy.  [Loud holler from the audience.]  I know all you guys.  My mom, my wife, my buddy Dwight, who are here.  My little boys, Willie and Harry.  My brothers, John and Jimmy.  Harvey Weinstein, Bob Weinstein, God bless 'em.  Larry Meistrich at The Shooting Gallery.  Miss Elizabeth Taylor and, gosh... and Mick's ballerina.  It's a private joke; I said I'd say it. Anyway, this is a terrific honor and, you know, this is the big one.  What can you say?  To the Academy, all you people who supported everything this year, not just this, and a bunch of great actors and crew people in this movie, God bless you all.  Thanks.

1996,Honorary Award,To Michael Kidd in recognition of his services to the art of the dance in the art of the screen.," MICHAEL KIDD:
Thank you, Jools.  Jools, you're a treasure for being here.  Thank you.

I didn't know how to handle all this, but my wife Shelah, who was my assistant on many of these pictures and naturally bore the brunt of my grouchiness, said to me:  Michael, the Academy is honoring you.  For once stop being Mr. Bah Humbug and try to enjoy it, at least for your family and friends' sake.  Well, she's not only beautiful, she's right.  So, Shelah, and Matthew, Amy, Kris, and Susan -- and even Julie [Andrews] who calls me an old curmudgeon -- and the many friends who wrote or phoned with the same message, once the reality of all this sinks in I promise to enjoy it.  I've even had my glasses tinted slightly rose-colored.

So many of today's films stress the terrors that await us.  Perhaps this award signifies an awareness that we have been missing something, namely the vitality and the joy of living that movie musicals can express in song and dance.  I thank the Academy for this tribute.  I accept it in the name of all choreographers and especially the dancers who made it all possible.  We feel honored.  Thank you.

Thank you so much.  We're running so late this is becoming sort of a ""Depends"" moment for me.  I want to remind everybody that it was only a year ago exactly to this day that we wrapped principal photography on ""Titanic."" And what a year it's been.  It's gone from being a ship of fools to a ship of dreams.  And that's Jim, Jim all the way.  He stuck to his guns.  Thank you, Jim.  I want to thank my crew that kicked some serious stern, and I love them for it.  And my wife Patricia, you save me in every way a person could be saved.  Thank you.  I love you.

1997,Best Picture,"James Cameron and Jon Landau, Producers"," JON LANDAU:
So this morning I woke up and couldn't wait for the day to be over.  Now I don't want it to stop.  I can't act and I can't compose and I can't do visual effects, so I guess that's why I'm producing.  But I have a lot of people that I have to thank on behalf of both Jim and myself.  I want to thank all the nominees here this evening, and all the people that again they've already thanked.  Our incredible cast, we would not be here without you.  My wife Julie, my sons Jamie and Jody.  Rae Sanchini, who is absolutely one of the best people in this industry.  My mom and dad, Edie and Ely.  And now a run through our quick list of credits here:  Josh McLaglen, Mali Finn, Gig Rackauskas, Simon Crane, Jimmy Muro, John Buckley, Lloyd Moriarity, Charles Lee, Martin Laing, Roger Barton, Charlie Arneson, Steve Quayle, Kevin De LaNoy, Lance Julian, Roger Hanna, Tommy Gordon, Les Collins, Tony Graysmark, Doug Fenton, Harry Heeks, Randy Gerston, Grant Hill, Sharon Mann and Anna Roth.  This movie would not have been made except for the conviction and belief of Peter Chernin, Bill Mechanic, Tom Sherak, Jim Gianopulos, Tom Rothman, Sanford Panitch, Vicki Rossellini, Ted Gagliano, Mike Jenkinson, Jim Darbirian, Hilary Clark*, Jon Dolgen, Sherry Lansing, Rob Friedman, John Goldwyn, Arthur Cohen, Wayne Lewellen, Nancy Goliger, Blaise Noto, Greg Brilliant, John Rentsch, Allison Jackson, Maren Moebius, and Steve Panama*. We would not be here without an incredible screenwriter who wrote a great script, Jim Cameron.

JIM CAMERON:
I think Jon saw ""Shine"" too many times.  He thanked everybody and did everything I was going to say.  And my eyes are still sort of doing pinwheels from the last one, so I just want to say a couple of things.  We're here tonight to celebrate the magic of movies.  And I'm grateful every day to get to be a part of that magic and a practitioner in it, and I love it.  And tonight has been such a great celebration for us.  And it seems to somehow express this strange wave that's happened with ""Titanic,"" where people all over the world have opened their hearts to this movie.  And that's so gratifying to all of us that worked on it and we'll be forever grateful to them, the audience, and I know a lot of you are watching at home.

In the midst of all this euphoria, it's kind of hard for us to remember that this euphoria and the success is for a film that's based on a real event that happened, where real people died, that shocked the world in 1912.  So I'd just like everybody to go with me just for a second on something here.  I'd like to do a few seconds of silence in remembrance of the 1,500 men, women and children who died when the great ship died.  The message of ""Titanic"" of course is, that if the great ship can sink, the unthinkable can happen, the future is unknowable, the only thing that we truly own is today.  Life is precious.  So during these few seconds I'd like you to also listen to the beating of your own heart which is the most precious thing in the world.  Join me please in a few seconds of silence for ""Titanic"" . . . . Thank you very much. That's about as much as I'm sure Gil Cates can stand.  All right, you've really made this a night to remember in every way.  Now let's go party till dawn.

1999,Actor in a Supporting Role,Michael Caine," MICHAEL CAINE:
Thank you, thank you.  I was looking [gesturing to the monitor], watching all the others, and thinking back when I saw the performances and I was thinking of how the Academy changed ""The winner is..."" to ""The Oscar goes to..."".   And if ever there was a category where the Oscar goes to someone without there being a winner, it's this one.  Because I do not feel like being the winner. You have Michael, who I'd never heard of quite frankly, who is astonishing. You have Jude, who is going to be a big star no matter what happens.  You have Tom, who if you had won this your pot price would have gone down so fast. Have you any idea what supporting actors get paid?  And we only get one motorhome, a small one.  And Haley Osment, what an astonishing... where is he? There he is.  Haley, when I saw you I thought, well that's me out of it.  So really, I'm basically up here, guys, to represent you as what I hope you will all be, a survivor.

I want to -- I've got to hurry up or they... Dick [Zanuck], I wasn't here last time, so give me a bit with my speech, the last time I won, so give me a bit extra time, okay?  I want to thank Harvey and Bob Weinstein and Meryl Poster at Miramax.  Lasse Hallström, an extraordinary director, and Richard Gladstein.  The wonderful actors I worked with: Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker -- all people who inhabit rather than act. And the wonderful children that I acted with there.  And last of all, I want to thank my two daughters, Dominique and Natasha, and my wife.  Thank you.

I share this award with an artist whose unique brilliance I got to glimpse twenty years ago in a wickedly funny short film about a demented dentist, director Tim Burton, whose compelling vision of ""Sleepy Hollow"" was the inspiration we all keyed off of.  I also share it with two gifted art directors, Les Tomkins and John Dexter, and three wonderful art departments in London, L.A. and New York.  I'm grateful for the support and the prodding of producer Scott Rudin, Adam Schroeder and Larry Franco and the backing of Paramount Pictures' Sherry Lansing and Michelle Manning and Nan Morales.

I think I'll hold it, I don't want to let go of it now.  I feel as if I'm in ""A Star Is Born"" and any minute now ""Norman Maine"" is going to come out and whack me in the mouth.  Well, obviously my thanks start with the great Robert Altman who has given me the biggest break in the movies since Lana Turner walked into Schwab's.  And then Scott Greenstein and USA.  Capitol Films. Ileen Maisel, who told me to write.  Bob Balaban, who got me the job.  Cathy King, Duncan Heath, Ronni Chasen.  And of course my terrific son Peregrine and my wife, the beautiful Emma, who has a lot to put up with.  When I'm not working I'm mean, moody and difficult.  And then when I start on a new job I change into someone who is even more mean, moody and difficult.  But finally, I want to thank the Academy and all of you for your tradition of kindness to foreigners like myself.  I think you must be the most generous nation on earth.  So thank you very much and God bless America.

2001,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,Arthur Hiller," ARTHUR HILLER:
Thank you, Mama.  Thank you, Papa.  It feels humbling to receive a humanitarian award for doing what my parents brought me up to do.  I had an unbelievably caring mother and father who lived their lives with the moral values of love and compassion, of respect and responsibility, of human dignity and standing up for what's right.  Even though they had a hard time earning a living they helped the poor and the hungry and they also helped others who needed the support of a friend or someone to stand up for their rights.  They felt all other people as individual human beings and judged them by their actions, not by their color or their race or their religion.

I wish I could say that I'm as strong as they were in all those areas, but I'm so grateful to them for instilling these values in my loving sisters and me.  And I'm so grateful to my loving wife and our wonderful children.  My wife's so supportive.  And Henryk and Erica just can't be better.  Gwen and the kids are always behind me and sometimes pushing me to live up to those values.  It's so embarrassing to receive an award for doing what you should be doing, but I must admit it pleases me greatly.  And it especially honors me to receive it from this Academy that I respect so deeply and that has always meant so much to me personally.  Thank you.

To all the people in ""Adaptation"" who helped to make this the most enjoyable job I ever had, thank you.  Charlie Kaufman, Spike Jonze, Nicolas Cage.  The fabulous, beautiful, wonderful Meryl Streep.  Working with this woman was like making great jazz. You had a lot to do with this, so I thank you.

To my wife, Marianne, you took on all the burden, thank you.  And in light of all the troubles in this world, I wish us all peace.  Thank you.

Thanks to Dick Cook and his incredible distribution team at Disney.  Thanks to the Academy, to my loving parents, to my adoring children.

But I just want to thank the holy trinity of Pixar--my good friend John Lasseter, Ed Catmull, Steve Jobs--for making the greatest studio on the face of the earth. And I want to thank my producer John Walker, and Dick Cook, and the great Disney marketing team.

You know, animation is about creating the illusion of life, and you can't create it if you don't have one. So, I want to thank my wonderful crew for the creation, and I want to thank my mom, my dad, my wife Liz, and my kids Jack, Michael and Nick for giving me my life. I love you. And thank you.

2004,Directing,Clint Eastwood," CLINT EASTWOOD:
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'd like to thank my wife, who is my best pal, down here. And my mother, who was here with me in 1993. She was only eighty-four then. But she's here with me again tonight. So, at ninety-six, I'm thanking her for her genes.

It was a wonderful adventure. To make a picture in thirty-seven days it takes a well-oiled machine. And that well-oiled machine is a crew--the cast, of course, you've met a lot of them, but there's still Margo and Anthony and Michael and Mike and Jay and everybody else who was so fabulous in this cast. And the crew: Campanelli and Billy Coe and, of course, Tom Stern, who is fantastic. And Henry Bumstead, the great Henry Bumstead, who is the head of our crack geriatrics team. And Henry and Jack Taylor and Dick Goddard, all those guys. And Walt and everybody. I can't think of everybody now; I'm beginning to get a blank--but, Warren [Beatty], you were right. And thank you for your confidence earlier in the evening.

I'm just lucky to be here. Lucky to be still working. And I watched Sidney Lumet out there, who is eighty, and I figure, I'm just a kid. I've got a lot of stuff to do yet. So thank you all very much. Appreciate it.

Marc, thank you for your subtle mind, for your incredible talent. Also Richard is here, Richard Gladstein, a man who truly understands the power of music. I'm very thankful for this as well. And then my wife Elzbieta, who always surprises me with her intellectual passion and incredible taste. She's responsible for many good notes I've written. And to my friend and agent Anita Greenspan, thank you so much.

Who is left? Many people. But I'm too overwhelmed to really go on. I should certainly take opportunity to, as the first person in the room, to thank Harvey Weinstein for his support. And very thankful as well for supporting ""Finding Neverland"" and my case. Musicians [are] usually forgotten, but [they are] extraordinary people who made music alive, and without them the best music just doesn't exist. So, thank you very much. My collaborators in Poland and here in America--Krzysztof, Rafal, Leszek--thank you so much. I'm very, very honored.

ALBERT S. RUDDY:
Actually, this is the third award ceremony we've gotten to in this category, and tonight we won. And I would tell you every time I started going to this thing, I'd say, ""I'm going to enjoy myself whether I win or lose."" But believe me, as Arnold said, it's better to win! I love it. Thank you, everybody.

Now, this is a great honor that celebrates the talent of Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman and the genius of Clint Eastwood. Now, one other quick--I want to thank Anjelica Huston, who introduced me to F.X. Toole, and Paul Haggis for writing a brilliant screenplay. The only thing left for me to do in my life now is thank my wife, who believed when I was worried; my two great children. I'm going to sit down and get a piece of lemon pie with the real filling, I'm going to look at this, and then I'm going to die and go to heaven. Thank you.

First of all, I want to thank two people who don't even exist, or I should say, they do exist because of the imagination of Annie Proulx and the artistry of Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana.  Their names are ""Ennis"" and ""Jack"" and they taught all of us who made ""Brokeback Mountain"" so much about, not just all the gay men and women whose love is denied by society, but just as important, the greatness of love itself.  Thank you.  Thank you, members of the Academy, for this tremendous honor.  And to everyone at Focus Features, in particular David Linde, James Schamus, thank you for your love and support. To Bill Pohlad, Tory Metzger, Ira Schreck, Joe Dapello, many thanks.  And a special thanks to David Lee.  And thanks to my wife Jane Lin and my boys Han and Mason.  I love you.  On ""Brokeback"" I felt you with me every day.  I just did this movie after my father passed away; more than any other, I made this for him.

2005,Honorary Award,To Robert Altman in recognition of a career that has repeatedly reinvented the art form and inspired filmmakers and audiences alike.," ROBERT ALTMAN:
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks very much.  I've got a lot to say, and they've got a clock on me.

I want to thank everybody for this, the Academy.  I was really honored and moved to accept this award.  When the news first came to me about it, I was caught kind of off guard.  I always thought this type of award meant that it was over.  And then it dawned on me that I was busy in rehearsals on a play that I'm doing in London right now.  It opened last night, Arthur Miller's last play, ""Resurrection Blues.""  I was doing an interview for my new film that I just finished, ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" which will come out in the summer.  And I realized that it's not over.  Of course I was happy and thrilled, and thrilled to accept this award.  And I look at it as a nod to all of my films because, to me, I've just made one long film.  And I know some of you have liked some of the sections, and others you....  Anyway, it's alright.

And I want to thank all of the people that have worked on all my pictures so hard, the brilliant actors, the amazing crews.  And I can't name them all so I'm going to name a doctor who is taking care of me, Jody Kaplan*.  So she represents everybody who have supported me and made it possible.

I've always said that making a film is like making a sandcastle at the beach. You invite your friends and you get them down there and you build this beautiful structure, several of you, and then you sit back and watch the tide come in.  Have a drink, watch the tide come in and the ocean just takes it away.  And that sandcastle remains in your mind.  Now I've built about forty of them, and I never tire of it.  No other filmmaker has gotten a better shake than I have.  I'm very fortunate in my career.  I've never had to direct a film I didn't choose or develop.  I love filmmaking.  It has given me an entree to the world and to the human condition and for that I'm forever grateful.

Finally I'd like to thank my family—you're all up there, all of them, almost—for their love and support through the years.  And most importantly, I want to thank and applaud my wife Kathryn Reed Altman, without whom I wouldn't be here today.  I love you, Trixie.  Thank you.

Oh, one more thing.  I'm here, I think, under kind of false pretenses, and I think I have to become straight with you.  Ten years ago, eleven years ago, I had a heart transplant.  A total heart transplant.  I got the heart of, I think, a young woman who was about in her late thirties, and so by that kind of calculation, you may be giving me this award too early.  Because I think I've got about forty years left on it.  And I intend to use it.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.
"
2006,Actor in a Leading Role,Forest Whitaker," FOREST WHITAKER:
Thank you.  Thank you.  Just a second, just a second.  Okay.  Take it [in], okay.  I wrote something down because I thought if it would happen I would be a little overwhelmed and I am.  So, okay.

When I was a kid the only way that I saw movies was from the backseat of my family's car at the drive-in, and it wasn't my reality to think I would be acting in movies.  So receiving this honor tonight tells me that it's possible, it is possible for a kid from east Texas, raised in South Central L.A., in Carson, who believes in his dreams, commits himself to them with his heart, to touch them and to have them happen.  Because when I first started acting, it was because of my desire to connect to everyone, to that thing inside each of us, that light that I believe exists in all of us.  Because acting for me is about believing in that connection; and it's a connection so strong, it's a connection so deep that we feel it and through our combined belief we can create a new reality.

So I want to thank my fellow believers in ""The Last King of Scotland.""  I want to thank Peter, Jeremy, Andrea, Lisa, Charles, Kevin, James McAvoy, Kerry, Stephen, Fox, DNA, Channel Four.  I want to thank the people of Uganda, who helped this film have a spirit.  And finally, I want to thank my mom and my dad; I want to thank my wife Keisha, my children, my ancestors who continue to guide my steps, and God, God who believes in us all and who's given me this moment in this lifetime that I will hopefully carry to the end of my lifetime into the next lifetime.  Thank you.

2006,Actor in a Supporting Role,Alan Arkin," ALAN ARKIN:
I know you're not supposed to read but I'd be totally incoherent if I didn't. It's handwritten, it's short.

More than anything I am deeply moved by the open-hearted appreciation our small film has received, which in these fragmented times speaks so openly of the possibility of innocence, growth and connection. Acting for me has always been and always will be a team sport. I cannot work at all unless I feel a spirit of unity around me. So my main sense of gratitude goes to the entire cast and crew and production team of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" for creating the same sense of joy and trust and community that the film speaks about.

I'd like to thank the Academy, Fox Searchlight, my wife Suzanne, my sons Adam, Matthew and Tony for their endless support. My representation: Estelle, Lee, Frank and Melody. And for the great teachers I've had throughout my life, both in and out of the profession. Thank you very much.

This award is a recognition for the collective effort to support the vision of the genius of Guillermo Del Toro.  ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is the result of this narrative that adds up to, in finding the look of the movie and the narrative to continue into this incredible story that unfolds. The creative freedom that was needed to tell the story and to preserve the integrity of the story and the point of view is what was more important for us in this movie.

2007,Honorary Award,To Robert Boyle in recognition of one of cinema's great careers in art direction.," ROBERT BOYLE:
Oh, thank you all.  That's the good part of getting old.  I don't recommend the other.

Well, it's not possible for me to express my appreciation to the countless people who helped me on this great trip, this wonderful journey of being in the movies.  But I can thank the members of the Board of Governors of the Academy, and to Nicole Kidman who so graciously introduced me.

I would like to remember some of the old folk, like Hans Dreier, who took a chance and gave me my first job in the movies.  And to Hitch, who also took a chance and gave me my first big film.  And I also would like to remember that Hitch introduced me to the screenwriter Bess Taffel, who became my wife and my companion throughout this wonderful journey.  I also would like to thank my children and grandchildren who supported me with their love and support, thank them.

And to Norman Jewison who made moviemaking fun and much laughter while dealing with real subjects.  And to Don Siegel, who cut to the chase and gave us truth.  And with all of these there was my beginning at the USC School of Architecture and my great colleagues in the Art Directors Guild who supported me.  And finally, to Jean Firstenberg who introduced me to the American Film Institute and the opportunity to give back to the next generation of storytellers.

Since I've been around here for almost a century, I've noted a lot of conflicts, but there was one bright image in this whole life of ours, and that was the arts, and particularly the art of the moviemakers, of the moving image that we all love.  So I have had the good fortune to be a part of this and I thank you all for being there for me.  Thank you.

I dearly want to thank everyone that's been on this film:  the cast, the crew, everybody at Disney and Pixar Studios.  I have to single out Ed Catmull, John Lasseter and Steve Jobs for creating a cinematic safe haven where only a film like ""WALL-E"" could be made.  To my wife Julie, my kids Ben and Audrey, I love you so much. And I guess I'd be remiss if I did not thank my high school drama teacher, Phil Perry, for twenty-eight years ago casting me as ""Barnaby"" in ""Hello, Dolly!.""  Creative seeds are sown in the oddest of places.   So, thank you so much to the Academy for this.

2008,Cinematography,Anthony Dod Mantle," ANTHONY DOD MANTLE:
I found that very inspiring, Natalie and Ben.  If I could use as few words on a set on a film like ""Slumdog"" and get away with it, I wish I could.  I wish I could.  It's fantastic.

I could thank thousands of people.  I can't do it.  I have to, of course, thank the Academy.  I'm very honored with this beautiful thing.  Everybody who has worked with me on this film--all over this room, especially over in this little corner here, in the blue corner.  And all the people that worked on all the films I've done for the last twenty years, they're with me tonight.  I'll try and thank you every day from now on.  That's my new policy.  I'll try and thank people more on set.

I want to thank, of course, the Academy for opening this door.  And there's something that goes hand in hand with that, that's my wife.  Because she keeps the door open when I come back.  She doesn't slam it.  And I want to thank her, 'cause she's amazing.  Sanne, you're a lovely lady.  She's a mother of two boys, August and Clements*, who are probably watching tonight.  Now, get to bed!  You're not meant to be up on the other side of the ocean.  I want to thank my ma and pa, of course, my brother John and my sister Annie.  Danny, it starts with you, but there are thousands of people with you and under you. They're all with me tonight.  I wanna just thank you so much.  Goodbye.

Thank you so much for this.  Thank you, everyone who voted for me.  This is incredible.  I just want to say I had a fantastic time working on this film. It was, um, I really didn't want it to end.  I had a wonderful time in India, and so I'd like to thank my crew in India firstly.  That was Vivek, Udayan, Anuradha.  They're all fantastic.  And also in England, Tina and Tom, who worked really hard in the editing with us, to get the film finished.  And also my family, my sisters Sally, Ally*, Lizzy*, my parents, my wife Clio who sort of put up with all the hours I was working, disappearing.

I certainly wouldn't be standing here tonight without Vikas Swarup, who wrote the book without which none of ""Slumdog"" would ever have happened.  So thank you, Vikas.  Tessa Ross from Film4, who shoved the manuscript into my hand and said, ""This is yours, you must go to India.""  Thank you.  My parents who've always supported me throughout everything.  My wife Jane, for whom repressed English writers have to write love stories, 'cause they can't really say what they mean.  Susan Landau and Charlotte Knight, both my manager and my agent. And of course the wonderful Dev, the wonderful Latika, and the cast and crew of the film who have taught me so much about India and so much about writing, and they've all sort of changed my life.  And finally, thank you so much to Danny and Christian, the other two musketeers.  Thank you very much.

2009,Honorary Award,To Roger Corman for his rich engendering of films and filmmakers.," ROGER CORMAN:
Needless to say I'm delighted to accept this Oscar personally, but I'd also like to accept it on behalf of my wife Julie, who's been my producing partner for many years, and also on behalf of those who've worked in the field in which I've spent most of my career, the independent filmmakers.

We all work in what I think is the only true modern art form.  All other arts had their origins in antiquity and are therefore, to a certain extent, static. Motion pictures encompass movement, which is one of the key characteristics of our day, and for that reason they are modern.  There's another reason as well. And the reason is that traditional art has been done, let us say, by composers, writers, poets, painters, who could create their art individually. Motion pictures require, the filmmaker requires a cast and a crew, and they must be paid.  As a result our art is somewhat compromised.  We're compromised between art and business and I think that represents something of the compromised world in which we live.

I think that to succeed in this world you have to take chances.  Many of my friends and compatriots and people who've started with me are here tonight, and they've all succeeded.  Some of them succeeded to an extraordinary degree. And I believe they've succeeded because they had the courage to take chances, to gamble.  But they gambled because they knew the odds were with them; they knew they had the ability to create what they wanted to make.  It's very easy for a major studio or somebody else to repeat their successes, to spend vast amounts of money on remakes, on special effects-driven tentpole franchise films.  But I believe the finest films being done today are done by the original, innovative filmmakers who have the courage to take a chance and to gamble.  So I say to you: Keep gambling, keep taking chances.  Thank you.

To my producer Darla Anderson, screenwriter Michael Arndt, my cast and crew, everyone at Disney and Pixar, every single person who had absolutely anything to do with making ""Toy Story 3"" and getting it out into the world, I share this with you.  To my grandmother, who always insisted that she'd see me up here someday.  To my parents, my wife Laura, my kids, Hannah, Alice and Max, I love you all so much.

2010,Honorary Award,To Kevin Brownlow for the wise and devoted chronicling of the cinematic parade.," KEVIN BROWNLOW:
If you've ever wondered what reflected glory looks like, this is it.  On behalf of all those film historians, film preservationists, and film collectors... I hear an intake of breath.  Not so long ago film collectors were endangered in this town by a knock on the door from the FBI.  I hope you have learnt that we were not your enemies.  But my god, your predecessors did a terrible job of preserving the silent era.  Historian David Pierce is about to reveal 73 percent has been destroyed.  Now, that's like a publisher taking Tolstoy, Dickens, Scott Fitzgerald, despulping every copy, and you can't even see the manuscript because they've burnt that as well.  So it's up to us to do our damnedest to find the films that your predecessors destroyed and bring them back into the canon.  An awful lot is being done as you know – the recent find in New Zealand, the recent generosity from Russia – but when I think of some of the titles that are gone it's really heartbreaking.

Now, I was told when I started this business that silent films were a complete waste of time.  They were jerky, flickery, ludicrously badly acted and appallingly photographed.  And I couldn't understand it because I was already a film collector and what I saw in beautiful prints, although sometimes abridged, were... I was struck by the freshness, the vitality, the innovation and the exquisite photography.  Ah, and I really do regret the loss of black and white.  It was a beautiful medium.  It called upon you to do some work, like silent film itself you have to supply the voices and sound effects, and with black and white you supply everything that the film suggested and therefore you become part of the creative process and it means that much more.

Now, film is a collaborative medium and I took it to its extremes.  I think I've worked on practically everything with a partner.  My wife, of course, of forty-one years.  She is wearing tonight jewelry given her by Alice Terry. Match that!  Then there are my partners: Andrew Mollo, twelve years; David Gill, twenty-three years, alas he died in '97; and I'd better not leave out my current producer, Patrick Stanbury; and Christopher Bird, the most recent co-director.

I've had a very fortunate life as you can guess.  And to give you an example: I was very impressed by the feature comedies of Harold Lloyd.  He seemed... If I wanted to convert someone to silent films I just ran them a Lloyd picture. That's all you had to do.  But you could not get hold of them.  He kept such close grasp that we were reduced to two for a long time, and I knew the fellow who had those two but he wouldn't even consider exchanging or selling them. Well, I wrote a fan letter to Harold Lloyd, and I was very disappointed.  He didn't answer.  Celebrities don't, you know.  And I was dozing one Sunday morning and I imagined that I had at last gone to Hollywood, and I was being shown around the Motion Picture Home by D.W. Griffith himself. And he said, ""Over there is a room with a great cameraman.  Over there lives a very fine editor.""  And at the end of the corridor the telephone rang.  And in my head I started tracking forward, as one does, and I dissolved through and my telephone was ringing.  So I went out into the hall and picked it up and a voice said, ""Kevin, you'll never guess who this is.  It's Harold Lloyd."" He invited me to the Dorchester Hotel, and then began a long and extremely fruitful friendship.  I loved him!  Actually, he was so charming he should have been the original of Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People.""

And I became fascinated by what these people did.  They were the most extraordinary people I've ever met in my life, when I finally got to America and met them en masse.  It was not just the stars, but the cameramen, the art directors and even the title writers.  I remember one of them, Monty Brice, told me that his first title writing job he was literally taken off the golf course.  Somebody had fallen ill; none of the title writers were getting anywhere near a good joke.  And so he came in in his rather loud knickerbockers, and these tough ex-newspapermen all looked at him and said, ""That's your title writing outfit, huh?""  And he said... he had no idea.  What he had to produce was a title which suggested that Al St. John had left for the city, had failed in everything he'd done and was returning.  He said to me, ""God send me a flash.  I said, 'How 'bout this boys:  Al left home to set the world on fire but had to come back for more matches.'""

Now, it is amazing what's turning up, and if you would only relax your copyright laws where silent films are concerned you would see an awful lot more suddenly appear.  That has been one of the worst chains on this whole affair of ours to try and rescue the past of the cinema.  And I'll just tell you one terrible story which sums it all up.  And I've got the film that – well, I shouldn't admit this because it's probably copyright – but I have the film in which this appears.  Junior Laemmle was in charge of the Collegians series at Universal.  And there's a sporting event, a swimming event, which one college wins and they build bonfires and they come home and have a wild party, or come back to the college and have the wild party, setting the bonfires alight.  But it doesn't burn, they don't burn strongly enough.  And Junior Laemmle says, ""Pile on the silent negatives; we'll never need them again.""  And on that note, that cautionary tale, they burnt beautifully.  I'll leave you.  Thank you.
"
2010,Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award,Francis Ford Coppola," FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA:
Well, George [Lucas] is the closest thing I have to a younger brother, so you can imagine the affection and the pride I have in him.  But there were so many... I'm about three or four or five years older than the wonderful generation that did so much, so I'm very proud of them.  And the fact that this is the Thalberg Award is, the significance is not lost on me.  Because this is an award for producing.  This is not about my own writing and my own filmmaking, but this is about the talent that I came to really value.  And it's more about ""American Graffiti"" and ""The Black Stallion"" and ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" and I could go on, about ""Napoleon"" performed in the Radio City Music Hall with a live orchestra.  That happened because I'd always heard from my father that in the days when he was a boy, when he went to the movies to see ""Don Juan"" or ""The Thief of Bagdad,"" that there was a symphony orchestra.  And I said, gee, I'd love to see that.  And the way to see it was to take the ""Napoleon"" restoration and get a full-out symphony orchestra and perform it.  And it was a wonderful hit.  It was riveting.  And I'm so proud of the fact that that tradition of once again combining live music with the great silent films, or with any film, has become really something that we can see.

I don't have any words prepared.  In fact, I'm shooting a picture, and last night – we're shooting nights, so I went to bed around four in the morning last night.  And I said, well, I'll just get up and thank everyone for this honor.  I remember seeing the Thalberg Award given and thought, wow, that's fantastic.  And in a way, although I still consider myself a relatively young person, I'm one of the few people you'll meet today who actually worked for Jack Warner and had him say, ""No fog on the lake!""  Or Sam Goldwyn when he said to me, you know, [imitating:] ""Your films, I like your films for the spontinuity"" [purposefully mispronounces], he said to me.  So I had the pleasure – I do a great Samuel Goldwyn, as does Warren [Beatty].  He said to me, Samuel Goldwyn said to me, he said [imitating:] ""What are you doing? You're a Goldwyn Scholar.  You're so great.""  I said, well I want to direct, too.  [Imitating:] ""Direct?  You should be a writer.  Writer, you are a writer. You're a great writer. Write! Write! Write!""  So a year later I made a film, and I got a letter: Mr. Goldwyn would like to see you.  He said, [imitating:] ""Oh, you're a Goldwyn Scholar –"" This is really the way he talked, by the way, I'm not...  [Imitating:] ""You're a Goldwyn Scholar.""  He said, ""What are you doing?""  I said, well, I'm thinking of writing a new film. [Imitating:] ""Writing?  You're a director now!  Writers are nothing.  Direct! Direct!  Direct!""  So, you know, Adolph Zukor, Darryl Zanuck, who incidentally, as was said, was the first winner of the Thalberg Award, and I think he won it more than once as a matter of fact.  So I have a great love of the original Hollywood tradition, certainly going back to the silents which were some of the most beautiful movies ever made.  Murnau, by the way, had said himself, he said, ""The coming of sound to movies was inevitable, but it came too soon.""  It came too soon, which there is some truth in.  Those were beautiful films.

I, you know, I'm so proud of my family: my wife of forty-eight years, Eleanor, who's here; my fabulous children.  I made a very wise decision when I was a young guy.  I said to my wife, if I ever go away for more than two weeks I want to take the kids out of school – imagine that today – take the kids out of school.  I'm taking them with me.  And we always did, and as a result we had our family together through all of those adventures in the Philippines and what have you.  So, and then of course the other children in the Schwartzman family, and of course in, I can't say the Cage family, but we're very proud of Nicolas as you can imagine.  So I could tell you lots of stories but I haven't prepared any notes or anything other than to thank you from the bottom of my heart.  And my admiration for the tradition of Irving Thalberg and, of course, of the fantastic producers who have won it, and not the least of it is Dino. You know, what a loss, to lose... [imitating:] ""Dino, eh.  You know, Francis...""  I don't do Dino so well.  I think Warren does Dino.  At any rate, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I thank my family.  I thank my friends.  So many of my friends are here tonight and people I've worked with, my colleagues, and the people whose films I've admired.  Thank you so much. Thank you.

Just a few jokes. Okay.

I'd  like to thank everyone who worked with me on the film, especially James Bobin for doing such a perfect job of bringing the song to life on screen. Mickey Petralia, for getting such a sweet sound. Disney, for making movies with songs in them. My wife Hannah, our two kids, Vita and Leo, for all their love and support.

And he directed movies like ""The Two of Us,"" ""Jean de Florette,"" and produced and worked with directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Milos Forman, Pedro Almodovar, Roman Polanski.

You inspired the movie and you're the soul of the movie and the positive feeling of the movie. Thank you for being this in the movie and in my life.

No, Hugo.

EUGENE GEARTY:
Oh. I'd like to thank the members of the Academy. My crew back in New York City, you know who you are. Thelma, whose indefatigable work ethic is an inspiration to all of us. And Marty, thank you so much for yet another opportunity to work on an ""other"" great film. Thank you so much.

PHILIP STOCKTON:
I just want to thank everybody who's here tonight and everybody who isn't, and everybody who's ever been born or may be born or be born again or reborn. If I've forgotten anybody then you probably know who you are. I specifically want to thank Graham King and Tim Headington, my wife Gail, my daughter Julia. Thelma, Marty, I love you guys. Thank you.

2012,Actor in a Leading Role,Daniel Day-Lewis," DANIEL DAY-LEWIS:
I really don't know how any of this happened. I do know that I've received so much more than my fair share of good fortune in my life and I'm so grateful to the Academy for this beautiful honor. It's a strange thing because three years ago, before we decided to do a straight swap, I had actually been committed to play Margaret Thatcher... and Meryl was Steven's first choice for Lincoln. And I'd like to see that version. And Steven didn't have to persuade me to play Lincoln but I had to persuade him that perhaps, if I was going to do it, that ""Lincoln"" shouldn't be a musical.

My fellow nominees, my equals, my betters, I'm so proud to have been included as one amongst you. When we got married sixteen years ago – or since we got married sixteen years ago – my wife Rebecca has lived with some very strange men. I mean they were strange as individuals and probably even stranger if taken as a group. But luckily she's the versatile one in the family and she's been the perfect companion to all of them. I'd like to thank Kathy Kennedy, our producer, and through you, Kathy... and through you, our mighty team of co-conspirators. At the apex of that human pyramid there are three men to whom I owe this and a great deal more: Tony Kushner; our beloved skipper Steven Spielberg; and the mysteriously beautiful mind, body and spirit of Abraham Lincoln. For my mother. Thank you so much.

I'd like to thank John Lasseter, Ed Catmull, Jim Morris, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, Brenda Chapman, Katherine Sarafian for making the making of ""Brave"" an exceptional story. My wife and my four kids: Maeve, Jack, Paden and Ford.

I mean, I was really into, you know, Ang and the beautiful world that we... It was like one challenge. When you're a cinematographer and there's like one thing that just kind of... when you just have your eyes and you just kind of go up and up and up and up and up, and you just kind of reach this thing. Then you get really excited. There's exciting scenes for me that I love, like the candles and the things that we did that was nuts. Ah, Jesus... but it was really great. And I'd like to thank everyone that made this thing totally possible. The Academy, Fox... and oh my God I can't even speak. I know, wrap up now, the whole thing. Yeah, but I'd like to thank my wife, my daughter's up there. And... everyone, thank you so much.

2012,Best Picture,"Grant Heslov, Ben Affleck and George Clooney, Producers (accompanied on stage by composer Alexandre Desplat, screenwriter Chris Terrio, exec. producer Chay Carter, and actors Bryan Cranston and Alan Arkin)"," GRANT HESLOV:
I know what you're thinking: the three sexiest producers alive. I want to thank the Academy; this is truly an honor. There are literally thousands of people to thank, so thankfully I'm not gonna thank them now. I'm going to thank everybody personally in the next few weeks, but there are a couple of people I want to acknowledge. I want to acknowledge my partner in crime and my great friend, George Clooney, who... Everybody should be so lucky to have a partner who is as talented and as humorous and who has as much integrity. So, thank you, George. I want to thank my beautiful wife Lysa; you make everything better. And to our kids, Maya and Olivia, I love you guys. I hope your old man's not embarrassing you up here. The reason I wanted to speak first – I wanted to speak before Ben – was Ben is a producer on the film and he is also our director. And I thought it would be awkward for Ben to thank himself, but it's not awkward for me. So on behalf of George and myself, I want to thank you, Ben. You directed a hell of a film. Couldn't be more proud of the film; couldn't be more proud of Ben. So ladies and gentlemen, our co-producer and the director of ""Argo"": Ben Affleck.

BEN AFFLECK:
Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. I know eventually that thing is gonna start to go, so forgive me if this is a little bit quick. I want to acknowledge Steven Spielberg, who I feel is a genius and a towering talent among us. I want to acknowledge the other eight films. There are eight great films that have every right, as much a right to be up here as we do. I want to acknowledge them and thank them for what they did, and for many of them who didn't even get nominated this year.

I want to thank, you know, I mean, Jack McNiece*, and Jerry Speck*, and Marty Brest, and my brother, and my mom and dad, and Patrick Whitesell, and Tony Mendez, who let us do his story. Thank you. And I'm gonna forget – I thank everyone in the movie, on the movie, worked on the movie, did anything with this movie, gets thanked. I want to thank Canada. I want to thank our friends in Iran living in terrible circumstances right now. I want to thank my wife – who I don't normally associate with Iran, but... I want to thank you for working on our marriage for ten Christmases. It's good. It is work but it's the best kind of work, and there's no one I'd rather work with.

And I just want to say, you know, I was here fifteen years ago or something, and, you know, I had no idea what I was doing. I stood out here in front of you all, really just a kid, and I went out, you know, and I never thought that I would be back here. And I am because of so many of you who are here tonight, because of this Academy, because of so many wonderful people who extended themselves to me when they had nothing to benefit from it in Hollywood. You know what I mean? I couldn't get 'em a job. I want to thank them and I want to thank what they taught me, which is that you have to work harder than you think you possibly can. You can't hold grudges. It's hard but you can't hold grudges. And it doesn't matter how you get knocked down in life, because that's gonna happen. All that matters is that you gotta get up. Violet, Sam and Sera, I love you; this is for you.

I'm very much not prepared for this. Jim Erickson, who's the set decorator, shares this honor. And all of us who worked on this movie of ""Lincoln,"" I think in our own ways tried to be worthy of a legacy that's way beyond all of us. Especially Steven and Kathy and Tony and Sally, but of course, Daniel, who actually convinced us that he was Lincoln. And the legacy that I think that he personified for all of us goes to our heart and it's worth far more than any gold that any of us could ever have. And I just thank you. And I love my wife, Adele.

2012,Honorary Award,"To Hal Needham, an innovator, mentor, and master technician who elevated his craft to an art and made the impossible look easy."," HAL NEEDHAM:
Ah man. When I found out I was gonna receive this award they said, who do want to speak on your behalf. The first name out of my mouth, Al Ruddy. And I knew it. Because he's got more funny stories – but when you're a director that's not all good, because he's got the damn cast over here telling 'em stories and I'm waiting on him. I'd say, Ruddy, let 'em up. He'd let 'em up, they'd come over. Once I cut, they'd be back over listening to Ruddy. [To Ruddy next to him on stage:] Are you gonna stand here and listen to me or are you gonna sit down?

Thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. You know something? You're looking at the luckiest man alive. And lucky to be alive. As a kid folks didn't think too much of me, of what I was gonna amount to. The reason, I was a sharecropper's son, way back in the hills of Arkansas during the Great Depression. With eight years of education. But for sure, for sure, my mom is looking down on tonight with a big smile on her face – sorry. By 1954, I'd served three years in the military as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division where I made over four hundred jumps. Most of those jumps were made testing parachutes. And on a lot of weekends I worked an aerial thrill show, which is perfect training for my first movie, ""The Spirit of St. Louis,"" that starred Jimmy Stewart. They were prepared to shoot a barnstorming sequence, all they needed was two guys to work on top of and underneath a couple of biplanes. The production manager was talking to my partner and I about how much we're going to charge them for the first stunt. Hell, I didn't know. I'd never done it before. I had no idea what'd be appropriate. But trying to get as much as I could I said, two thousand dollars every time we do it. A voice behind me said, ""For two thousand dollars I'll do it."" I looked around, it was the director, Billy Wilder. He walked past us, went down to the planes, climbed up on the top wing, buckled in. I said, this fool's got to be kidding. But he wasn't. He motioned the pilot to wind it up and took off. They bounced down across the field, made a couple of low passes and landed. When Billy Wilder climbed down off of that plane he says – he had a twinkle in his eye and a little smile on his face – and he said, ""Now how much do you want?"" We agreed that a thousand dollars would be just right. I worked six weeks on ""Spirit"" when they paid me more money than this cotton-pickin' kid had seen in his life. I now had a decision, a goal. I was gonna be a Hollywood stuntman.

When I got into the business the stunt equipment was, adequate. I know, because I broke fifty-six bones, my back twice, punctured a lung, had a shoulder replaced and knocked out a few teeth trying to use that stuff. But never believing that and the fact that that's the way it's always done, I came up with a few pieces of equipment that made the stunts more real, more active and a lot, lot easier. Safer. And that's really what I was looking for. A way to save myself some trips to the hospital.

You know, I didn't get here by myself; I had a lot of help. A lot of help. And I need to thank some of those folks. Like all the stuntmen and women who worked with me and for me, and made me look like I knew what I was doing. All the producers, directors, and stars that requested me. The Academy Board of Governors, for deciding to give me this award, this great award. And my wife Ellyn, for putting up with me for all these years, nursing me back to health many times, but best of all, the neverending love. Honey, you're the best; thank you. One last thing. I want to thank the entire Hollywood community for allowing me to be part of it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
"
2012,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,Jeffrey Katzenberg," JEFFREY KATZENBERG:
Thank you. Thank you first to the Academy and the Board. This is a truly great honor. And I have to thank both Tom and Will. To receive this award from two of our greatest talents and two people I am lucky to be able to call my friends is a distinct honor of its own, as it is to be here among movie legends Mr. Pennebaker, George Stevens and Hal Needham.

My story is of mentors. People who give of their time and their talents, of their words and their wisdom. People who encourage all of us to reach for more and in doing so inspire us. Inspire us to strive for exellence not only in ourselves but in each other. My first mentors, my parents, they gave me life and they gave me a deep appreciation for what it is to give to others. There are days between my second and third breakfasts when I think how lucky I was to have been mentored at such an early age. My mom, she passed away a little over a month ago, and I really regret that I never told her this enough. But my father is here tonight and, Dad, I want to say now just how much you mean to me and how much I love and appreciate you for all you have given to me.

Mentors. John Lindsay, the late, great mayor of New York, taught me the power of believing. Believing in an ideal. For when he looked out across a sea of problems and people in need, most of whom asked for nothing, said he wanted to try and make their world just a little bit better. And he did. This was an early lesson and a simple truth that each of us can and should make a difference.

Kirk Douglas. I met Kirk, as most of the world did, larger than life on a giant silver screen. Spartacus, a true hero. Then I had the honor of meeting him in real life and he was an even larger hero in person. It's Kirk who taught me you haven't learned to live until you've learned to give. It's a statement that echoes loudly and it is in many ways the mantra of Hollywood. Think of George Clooney and the Sudan. Think of Steven Spielberg and Shoah. Think of Angelina Jolie and the United Nations. Think of David Geffen, well, everything. The list is long and I am honored to be among the many.

In fact, standing here alone doesn't feel quite right to me. It projects a bit of a false image. Because mostly all I did was pick up the phone and ask you. It's you who did it. You who give of your time, your talent, your money, your hearts. Because that's what you do, that is what Hollywood does. And I know what it is to be asked. I was asked by Lew and Edie Wasserman, mentors. They asked me to take a moment to consider the Motion Picture Television Fund, and the ask was all that it took. A place to care for many of our nation's great artists and storytellers, a place for mentors to be safe and to be appreciated. You saw their faces, heard their voices in that video, and there is so much more. I stand here tonight on their behalf with particular pride because this award bears the name of Jean Hersholt. It was he nearly seventy-five years ago who was among the founders of the Motion Picture Relief Fund. I'm tempted to say it's the circle of life, but a circle implies something complete and we at the Fund have a greater horizon.

I will end with my thanks to the person who is every single day my greatest mentor. We met back in the John Lindsay days and we are here today as partners in giving and partners in living. The mother of my amazing children, she is my wife, and she is my life. Marilyn. And to all of you, I want to thank you again for giving so generously of your time, of your talent and of your hearts. You might say that all of us who work in the film industry, we actually live in two worlds. There's the imaginary world we project on the screen and then there's the real world that we live in every day. All of the other Oscars, they pay tribute to the talent that goes into the creation of those imaginary worlds. I believe this particular Hersholt Award is a recognition of the extraordinary generosity of our industry towards improving the real world that we all share. And it is with that in mind and, I think, really on your behalf that I humbly and proudly accept this amazing recognition. Thank you so very much.

2013,Actor in a Leading Role,Matthew McConaughey," MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY:
Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to the Academy for this, all six thousand members. Thank you to the other nominees. All these performances were impeccable in my opinion; I didn't see a false note anywhere. I want to thank Jean-Marc Vallée, our director. I want to thank Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner, who I worked with daily.

There's a few things, about three things, to my account that I need each day. One of 'em is something to look up to. Another is something to look forward to. And another is someone to chase. Now, first off, I want to thank God, 'cause that's who I look up to. He has graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand. He has shown me that it's a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. In the words of the late Charlie Laughton*, who said, ""When you've got God, you've got a friend. And that friend is you.""

To my family, that's who and what I look forward to. To my father, who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo. He's got a lemon meringue pie over there. He's probably in his underwear and he's got a cold can of Miller Lite. And he's dancin' right now. To you, Dad, you taught me what it means to be a man. To my mother who's here tonight, who taught me and my two older brothers – demanded – that we respect ourselves, and what we in turn learned was then we were better able to respect others. Thank you for that, Mama. To my wife Camila and my kids, Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone, the courage and significance you give me every day I go out the door is unparalleled. You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me. Thank you.

And to my hero; that's who I chase. Now, when I was 15 years old I had a very important person in my life come to me and say, ""Who's your hero?"" And I said, I don't know; I gotta think about that. Give me a couple of weeks. I come back two weeks later, this person comes up and says, ""Who's your hero?"" I said, I thought about it. You know who it is? I said, it's me in 10 years. So I turned 25; ten years later that same person comes to me and goes, ""So, are you a hero?"" And I was like, not even close! No, no, no. She said, ""Why?"" I said, because my hero's me at 35. So you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero's always 10 years away. I'm never gonna be my hero. I'm not gonna attain that; I know I'm not. And that's just fine with me, because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasin'.

So to any of us, whatever those things are: whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we're chasin'. To that I say: Amen. To that I say: Alright, alright, alright. To that I say: Just keep livin'. Thank you.

2013,Honorary Award,To Steve Martin in recognition of his extraordinary talents and the unique inspiration he has brought to the art of motion pictures.," STEVE MARTIN:
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. This is so nice, so nice of you. Ladies and gentlemen, it has been a longtime dream of mine that I would one day receive an Honorary Oscar, and tonight I feel I am one step closer to that dream. [Tom Hanks walks over to the podium to take a picture of himself with Martin.] Oh, cool. Hey! Thanks [laughs]. So now it's just, the class level has dropped completely. I can't possibly express how excited I am tonight, because the Botox is fresh. You know, it is said that the art and craft of filmmaking is collaborative, so to be singled out and rewarded tonight means that that is not true. [Looking around the room:] Is it my imagination or is this year's Oscar ceremony a little on the cheap side?

I must thank the people who spoke on my behalf tonight. My high school friend Bill Taylor. Bill – by the way, he was a distinguished visual effects artist and cinematographer – whoever thought we would meet more than fifty years later on such an auspicious stage. Congratulations on your life and career too, Bill. And following Bill, a comedian so renowned and funny, whose work has only grown over the years and who never fails to make us laugh in new and unique ways; if only we had had someone like that tonight. You should have seen Marty Short's face fall when I told him the gift basket was taxable. And then the beautiful speech by Tom Hanks. Thank you, Tom. Everybody loves Tom Hanks. What a talent. Tom Hanks...Tom Hanks...I saw ""Captain Phillips."" I didn't think it was so funny.

But seriously, I have so many people in my career to mention and thank. My very first manager back in the sixties, Bill McEuen. My first two agents, Marty Klein and John Gaines; some of you may remember them. John Gaines was all business. One time he called me and he said, ""Steve, two things. One: hello..."" Carl Reiner. How lucky was I to get with Carl Reiner, who taught me so much about how to work on a script. David Picker. Michael Gendler, my lawyer for over, I think it's thirty years is it, Michael? Something like that. I stick with people until they die. Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer. Nora Ephron. Frank Griffin, my makeup man for over – how many? Twenty years? More than that, more than that. Dan Melnick, a producer who had a great eye for a script. Fred Schepisi, who directed ""Roxanne."" John Hughes, who wrote and directed ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles."" I read the first script and it was, the first script was 165 pages long. I loved the script. I said to John, ""What are you thinking about cutting?"" And he said, ""Cutting?"" The first cut of the film was 4½ hours long.

Phil Robinson, who's here tonight, and wrote ""All of Me,"" which absolutely changed my career. Brian Grazer, another producer who kept his eye on the script. Ron Howard. David Mamet. Larry Kasdan, the great Larry Kasdan. Frank Oz, who's here tonight, who did so much great comedies, some of my best comedies with him. Mick Jackson, who directed ""L.A. Story."" John Landis, who directed the little movie that could, the ""¡Three Amigos!."" Bob Simonds. Ed Limato, God rest his soul. Adam Venit. So many of my agents have died; watch out, Adam. My wife Anne Stringfield, who is as beautiful as she is smart. And...hey [begins to tear up]. I knew I wasn't going to make it through this speech. I read it to my dog this morning and wept. My wife alone would have been enough reward for my life but now she has brought me a wonderful child. And for some mysterious reason she really loves that child. I don't know; I don't get it.

In 2008, Nancy Meyers asked me to appear in ""It's Complicated"" with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. And I hadn't done a movie in a long while and I didn't really know how I felt about them anymore. Because along with the joy that they had brought me over the past thirty-four years, people in this room know they also bring an equal amount of artistic heartache. And I went out to the set, across the Queensboro Bridge, on that cold winter morning. And on the first day of shooting I opened the door to the dark soundstage, and I stepped over all those black snaking electric cables, and walked past the craft service table that overflowed with boxes of raisins and bagels and muffins, and the slowest toaster in the world, and jars of M&M's and Twizzlers for breakfast, and every variety of mustard. And as I made this little journey that I had made a thousand times at every studio in this city, walking through the corridors, through this flimsy plywood flats, and the light changing from pitch black to blinding white, I thought: Home. So to get an award for something that you realize has seeped into your bones and to understand tonight that the work over the decades has at least meant something to someone is especially satisfying.

But working in the movies has also brought something, an amazing gift, that has accummulated through these decades of filmmaking that cannot be matched, something wonderful and magical and its impact on my life is profound. Friends – fascinating, funny, and lifelong. Many of them are here in this room tonight. So thank you, movies, and thank you, Academy, for this award and a glorious reminder of the true benefit that I have received.

Oh my god. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to the Academy. I don't think I'm capable of articulating quite how I feel right now. Please know this, I am fully aware that I am a lucky, lucky man. This, this Oscar... wow!  This Oscar, this belongs to all of those people around the world battling ALS. It belongs to one exceptional family:  Stephen, Jane, Jonathan and the Hawking children. And I will be its custodian. And I will promise you I will look after him – I will polish him; I will answer his beck and call; I will wait on him hand and foot. But I would not be here were it not for an extraordinary troupe of people. My staggering partner in crime, Felicity Jones. My ferocious and yet incredibly kind director, James Marsh. Working Title, Focus, Lisa and Anthony, Nina, and my ingenious team of Dallas, Josh, Gene, Jason, Elan, Carl*, Britney* and Carrie and Pip. Now, finally, please, this is so extraordinary.

There are so many people to thank. I want to thank Tess Gallagher, which is the widow of Raymond Carver, who allow us to use the Raymond Carver story, which is incredible. I want to thank Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuarón, as I mention already, because they have been part of, these two, all my life and my career. And [turning to the group behind him] I don't know if you have something to say. I just want to take the opportunity – Michael. I want to say Michael and all the cast, but Michael was the guy who really, really – Michael, come.

This has been a tremendous experience. This guy's as bold as bold can be. And it was just a tremendous honor for me to – look, it's great to be here. Who am I kiddin'? This is just great fun. Thank you very much.

ALEJANDRO G. IÑÁRRITU:
Finally, finally, I just want to, I want to take one second. I just want to take the opportunity. I want to dedicate this award for my fellow Mexicans. The ones who live in Mexico, I pray that we can find and build the government that we deserve. And the ones that live in this country who are part of the latest generation of immigrants in this country, I just pray that they can be treated with the same dignity and respect of the ones who came before and built this incredible immigrant nation.

2014,Honorary Award,"To Hayao Miyazaki, a master storyteller whose animated artistry has inspired filmmakers and audiences around the world."," HAYAO MIYAZAKI (via translator):
My wife tells me that I'm a very lucky man. And I think I've been lucky because I've been able to participate in the last era when we can make films with paper, pencil, and film. Another fact of luck is that my country has not been at war for the fifty years that I have been making films. Of course we've profited from wars, but we're very fortunate that we have not had to go to war ourselves. But my greatest luck is that I've been able to meet Miss Maureen O'Hara today. So I've been so happy and feel so blessed with luck in my life. Thank you.

[1:32] Here's to the fools who made me dream: my uncle Gary Platt; my mentor Sam Cohn; my parents; my children; my wife, Julie, on whose shoulders I've stood for 40 years, because she insisted I reach for the stars. And to the Hollywood community that I'm so proud to be a part of, and to the Hollywood in the hearts and minds of people everywhere, [behind Platt, a production crew member is showing the other two producers the correct winner card] repression is the enemy of civilization.

It is so humbling to be standing up here with hopefully still the ""La La"" crew? No, okay, they're gone. But it's very humbling to be up here. And I think, I hope even more than that, that it's inspiring to people, little black boys and brown girls and other folks watching at home, who feel marginalized and who take some inspiration from seeing this beautiful group of artists, helmed by this amazing talent, my friend Barry Jenkins, standing up here on this stage accepting this top honor. Thank you.

BARRY JENKINS:
There was a time when I thought this movie was impossible because I couldn't bring it to fruition, I couldn't bring myself to tell another story. And so everybody behind me on this stage said, no, that is not acceptable. So I just want to thank everybody up here behind me.

Good night. Thank you so much.

2016,Honorary Award,"To Jackie Chan, an international film star who has captivated millions with his wit, boundless energy and unparalleled athletic artistry."," JACKIE CHAN:
Academy Award! I still can't believe I'm standing here. It's a dream. Long time ago, every year when I watch Oscar with my dad, sometime with my mom. My dad always say, ""Son, you get so many movie award in the world. When are you get one of these?"" Then I just look at my dad: ""Ha, ha, ha. Dad, I only make comedy action movies."" Many years later I come to Hollywood, meeting with some big studio, director, my friend's house, Stallone's house. That was 23 years ago. I see these little things in his house. I touched it. I kissed it. I smelled it. I believe still have my fingerprints in; you keep it. Then I talk to myself, ""I really want one."" Finally, Cheryl calls. I said, ""Are you sure?"" After 56 years [in the] film industry, making more than 200 films, I break so many bones. Finally, this is mine. This is mine.

I want to thank you, Hong King, incredible city, my hometown, my hood, who make me. China, my country. Proud to be Chinese. Thank you, Hollywood, for all those years teaching me so many things, and also make me a little bit famous. And I thank you, my family, my wife Joan, my son Jaycee, my special Jackie Chan Stunt Team. This year it's the Jackie Chan Stunt Team 40 years anniversary. And all the friends, thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

And ladies and gentlemen, and also distinguished guests, and Academy Motion Picture Art and Science, thank you, thank you, thank you. And, and I want to thank you – who should I thank you? And I forget. I don't know! I just, it's honor to be here. It's my honor. Thank you. Thank you. [Music starts up.] Oh! Oh! Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! [Music stops.] Last, not least, million thanks to all my friends, fans around the world. Because [of] you I can, I have a reason continue to make movies, jumping in window, kicking and punching, keep breaking my bone. Thank you so much. Thank you, Oscar! Thank you!

2016,Honorary Award,"To Frederick Wiseman, whose masterful and distinctive documentaries examine the familiar and reveal the unexpected."," FREDERICK WISEMAN:
Thank you. Thank you. I'm very pleased to be here to receive the Board of Governors Honorary Academy Award. It's a great and wonderful recognition of the work I've been doing for 50 years. What's kept me going is that it's fun and an adventure. Constantly working also keeps me off the street, or at least on the streets that I like. While making the movies is physically and intellectually demanding it's rare that I felt any strain. I'm lucky I found work that I like and that I continue to be obsessed with. This compulsion has always been understood by my wife, Zipporah, and my sons, David and Eric. I am grateful and very appreciative for their constant support. They recognized long ago that I'm a New England Jewish Puritan and let me go my errant ways. I'm also very pleased that my grandchildren, Tess and Ben and Charlie, are here tonight to help me celebrate.

I want to thank Karen Konicek, who has run my production company, Zipporah Films, for 35 years, and whose unfailing good cheer and sound advice has made it possible to wander around and make movies. I also want to express my thanks and appreciation to John Davey, the terrific cameraman with whom I worked since 1979. I'm glad that both John and Karen are here tonight. I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the late William Brayne, the cameraman who worked with me on many earlier films. And also I want to thank the many others who helped in the production of the movies. Irwin Young, the President of DuArt Films, one of independent filmmaker's best friends, provided deferment deals which made many of my early films possible. I'm grateful to PBS for its support for all of my films. The films couldn't have made without – couldn't have not have been made without the constant support of The Ford Foundation and frequent grants from the MacArthur, Pershing Square, and LEF Foundations, ITVS and the Sundance Documentary Fund. Additional funding has sometimes been provided by my singing and selling pencils outside Neiman Marcus department stores.

Making a movie is always an adventure. I usually know nothing about the subject before I start, and I know there are those that feel I know nothing about it when it's finished. I never start with a point of view about the subject or a thesis that I want to prove. I also don't do any research in advance of the shooting. I usually don't know in advance what's going to be shot or what I'm gonna stumble across in any day or any moment of any day. The editing is an effort to impose order on the chaos of the rushes through the creation of a fictional form that provides meaning to the film. The goal is to make a film that is close to a, closer to a visual novel than a journalistic account. This process involves sitting in the editing room for eight to ten months, getting fed intravenously until the film is found.

Each film is also an opportunity to learn something about a new subject. I've been involved in a 50-year course in adult education, where I'm the alleged adult who studies a new subject every year. The variety and complexity of the human behavior observed in making one of the films, and cumulatively all of the films, is staggering. And I think it is as important to document kindness, civility and generosity of spirit as it is to show cruelty, banality and indifference. There are always a lot of laughs and I'm not the first to observe that so much of human behavior, my own and others, is when seen from a detached point of view, funny. For example, when I was working on the film that became ""Near Death,"" a film about dying patients, there were several occasions when we shot in the hospital morgue. On the last day of shooting I went around thanking the various staff who had been helpful. Among them was a man responsible for the morgue. I caught up with him in the hospital cafeteria and thanked him for his help. We shook hands warmly and he said, ""See you soon."" Thank you, and see you soon.

Well, my deepest thanks to the Academy and its members for this glorious prize. I owe this and so much more to so many. I've lived in America for the longest time and I am deeply grateful to her for the loves and the friendships I have made and the many wonderful gifts it has given me: my home, my livelihood, my family and now Oscar. The movies, such is their power, captivated a young man from South London and gave him a dream. And Douglas Urbanski, my dear, dear friend and brother, you have helped keep that dream alive. Joe Wright, thank you for this [holding out the Oscar]. It only took twenty years for us to work together, but it was well worth the wait. Thank you, Kazu, Lucy, David, for your artistry. Thank you, everyone at Working Title and Universal Focus, for your herculean efforts and support on this film. Thank you, Eric Fellner, Tim Bevan, Lisa Bruce, Anthony McCarten. Dani and her amazing team. And of course, Jim Osborne.

I would just like to salute Sir Winston Churchill who has been marvelous company on what can be described as an incredible journey, and my wife Gisele for traveling that road with me and being at my side. Thank you, Alfie, Gully, Charlie, William. My remarkable, remarkable fellow nominees, and my dear friend out there, Denzel. And obviously I'm not gonna win the, uh, you know, the ski. I would like to thank my mother who is older than the Oscar. She is 99 years young next birthday, and she is watching this ceremony from the comfort of her sofa. I say to my mother: Thank you for your love and support. Put the kettle on, I'm bringing Oscar home."

Some of my crew on ""Blade Runner"" I've been working with for over thirty years, and others I met for the first time in Budapest. And this is for every one of them, every one of them.

Okay, so we wanted to make a film that celebrates life, and four days into shooting the impossible happens. An accident on a highway took my daughter away. Someone looking into his cell phone. And we miss her and I love her. And… sorry. Two months before we shot this movie and two months before she died, she was in Africa. She sent me a letter. And she'd just read the script and she was glowing with excitement. She loved this. And she felt seen by this. And she was supposed to be in this. And if anyone dares to believe that she's here with us somehow, she – you'll be able to see her clapping and cheering with us. We ended up making this movie for her, as her monument.

My wife Emily Arlook and our baby boy Sonny McCormack, you've brought me more joy than I knew was possible. We dedicate this film to all those who've lost loved ones to gun violence. We deserve better than to live in a country where more than one hundred people die by gun violence every single day. We deserve better. We must do better. We will do better. Thank you."
2020,Visual Effects,"Andrew Jackson, David Lee, Andrew Lockley and Scott Fisher","SCOTT FISHER (in Los Angeles):
Well, all my colleagues are overseas. Unfortunately for them they have to let me speak, so this is what you get. It's amazing, amazing. Our visual effects team on ""Tenet,"" we did so many things and there's so many departments we have to thank. Not just in our own but in, you know, the art department and Nathan, and camera department, Hoyte. And of course, our stunt coordinator George Cottle, who's amazing. But it all goes back to our director Christopher Nolan. He leads us all and gives us amazing opportunities to do amazing things. And I'd like to thank my family, my wife, my amazing crew. And my father, who won this same award. Thank you."
2020,Writing (Adapted Screenplay),Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller,"FLORIAN ZELLER (via live remote from Paris, France):
Thank you. Thank you so much. It's such a great joy and such a great honor, and I share these joys and this award with Sir Christopher Hampton. We have worked together for years and I want to thank him for being such a great writer and such a wonderful friend. And I have to thank everyone involved in ""The Father"" and everyone who helped me to make that film, that script becoming a film. My producers, of course: Simon Friend, who first produced the play in London; the great David Parfitt; Philippe Carcassone; Jean-Louis Livi; Christophe Spadone. The Sony Classics family: Michael, Tom, Melody. All my team at CAA: Bryan – sorry, so many names that I have to mention – Federica, Chris, Andrew, Laurent, Olivier and Suzanne, thank you for being so supportive.

And the crew of ""The Father,"" of course, and the wonderful cast: Olivia Williams, Olivia Colman, Rufus Sewell, Mark Gatiss, Imogen Poots, and of course, Anthony Hopkins. I wrote the script for him. To me, he's the greatest, the greatest living actor. And just the idea to work with him was like a dream. And I knew that it was not an easy dream to fulfill because I'm French, as you can hear. It was my first feature film, and you know, he's Sir Anthony Hopkins. But I thought, until someone comes and proves that it was not possible, it means that potentially it is. And sometimes we are the one who close the door of what is possible and what is not possible. And for ""The Father,"" I really wanted not to close that door and to follow my inspiration, my desire and my dream. So thank you, Anthony, for having said yes to that script and thank you for having given everything to that film – your energy, your grace and your talent. Sharing that journey with you was the most amazing experience of my life. And at last, I want to thank my wife Marine for supporting me with love and patience. Thank you to the Academy."
2021,Actor in a Leading Role,Will Smith,"WILL SMITH:
Ah, man. Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family. In this time in my life, in this moment, I am overwhelmed by what God is calling on me to do and be in this world. Making this film I got to protect Aunjanue Ellis, who was one of the most, the strongest, most delicate people I've ever met. I got to protect Saniyya and Demi, the two actresses that played Venus and Serena. I'm being called on in my life to love people, and to protect people, and to be a river to my people. Now, I know to do what we do you gotta be able to take abuse, you gotta be able to have people talk crazy about you. In this business you gotta be able to have people disrespecting you and you gotta smile and you gotta pretend like that's okay. But Richard Williams, and what I loved -- thank you, D. Denzel said to me a few minutes ago, he said: At your highest moment, be careful; that's when the devil comes for you. It's like, I want to be a vessel for love. I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena -- I just spit; I hope they didn't see that on TV. I want to say thank you to Venus and Serena and the entire Williams family for entrusting me with your story. That's what I want to do. I want to be an ambassador of that kind of love and care and concern.

I want to apologize to the Academy. I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees. This is a beautiful moment, and I'm not, I'm not crying for winning an award. It's not about winning an award for me. It's about being able to shine light on all of the people -- Tim and Trevor and Zach and Saniyya and Demi and Aunjanue and the entire cast and crew of ""King Richard."" And Venus and Serena, the entire Williams family. Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father just like they said... I look like the crazy father just like they said about Richard Williams. But, love will make you do crazy things. To my mother -- a lot of this moment is really complicated for me -- but to my mother, she didn't want to come out. She had her knitting friends. She has a knitting crew that she's in Philly watching with. Being able to love and care for my mother and my family, my wife -- I'm taking up too much time. Thank you for this honor. Thank you for this moment. And thank you on behalf of Richard and Oracene, the entire Williams family. Thank you. I hope the Academy invites me back. Thank you."
2021,Actor in a Supporting Role,TROY KOTSUR,"TROY KOTSUR [via interpreter]:
This is amazing to be here on this journey. I cannot believe I'm here. Thank you so much to all the members of the Academy for recognizing my work. It's really amazing that our film, ""CODA,"" has reached out worldwide. It even reached all the way to the White House. And they invited the cast of ""CODA"" to visit and have a tour of the White House and we met President Joe and Dr. Jill, and I was planning on teaching them some dirty sign language but Marlee Matlin told me to behave myself. So don't worry, Marlee, I won't drop any F-bombs in my speech today.

Instead, I really want to thank all of the wonderful deaf theater stages where I was allowed and given the opportunity to develop my craft as an actor. Thank you. I read one of Spielberg's books recently, and he said that the best director, the definition of the best director was a skilled communicator. Siân Heder, you are the best communicator. And the reason why is you brought the deaf world and the hearing world together, and you are our bridge. And your name will forever be on that bridge, Siân Heder Bridge, here in Hollywood. And that was supported by Apple, Sundance, all our cast, our crew, our producers, and the community of Gloucester, Massachusetts. So I just want to say: Hey, fisherman. Hey, Popeyes. Don't forget to eat your spinach.

My dad, he was the best signer in our family. But he was in a car accident and he became paralyzed from the neck down, and he no longer was able to sign. Dad, I learned so much from you. I'll always love you. You are my hero. Thank you to my biggest fans: my wife and my daughter Kyra, and my hometown of Mesa, Arizona, and Mark Finley, my manager, and our team. I just wanted to say that this is dedicated to the deaf community, the CODA community, and the disabled community. This is our moment. To my mom, my dad and my brother Mark -- they're not here today, but look at me now. I did it! I love you. Thank you."

Wow. Listen, I'm so happy this award's up early so I can get out and get to the bar, but I will keep it short for that reason. Denis Villeneuve is a master. Master Denis. You know, he's brought a whole group of unknown actors together to make an amazing movie, along with our lovely producers. Thank you. Collaborators are nothing without this, with my friends Patrice and Paul and Donald and Jackie and, I mean, god, amazing. My crew: I'm not going to name them all because it will take too long, but I will call you all straight after this. And speaking of calling, Mum, I will return your call, and I apologize. Lauren, all the friends and family celebrating around the world, and Melvin. And most importantly, my wife Jodie, my children, Felix, Leo, and Poppy. Your allowing a middle-aged man to go out and play with his friends in the sand dunes for six months is pretty amazing, so thank you. I'll be home in time for dinner. Thank you guys."

Thank you. Thank you. My mom is 84 years old and she's at home watching. Mom, I just won an Oscar! My journey started on a boat. I spent a year in a refugee camp and somehow I ended up here on Hollywood's biggest stage. They say stories like this only happen in the movies. I cannot believe it's happening to me. This! This is the American Dream! Thank you so much, thank you so much to the Academy for this honor of a lifetime. Thank you to my mom for the sacrifices she made to get me here.

I want to thank the Henson Company and Lisa Henson. I want to thank my beautiful wife, and Sebastian as well, and this man [referring to del Toro] who was really the genesis of everything, including my drinking problem.

GUILLERMO DEL TORO:

2022,INTERNATIONAL FEATURE FILM,Edward Berger,"EDWARD BERGER:
Thank you. God, this means so much to us. So, I met so many new friends on this movie. My cinematographer James Friend, who's won an Academy Award. My costume designer Lisy Christl. My production designer Christian Goldbeck. My hair and makeup designer Heike Merker. And I owe everything to you, I owe everything to you and the rest of my crew. But the other day I walked into a brunch here and I met another cinematographer -- James, don't, don't, don't, don't, it's about another movie. And it was Florian Hoffmeister, who was also nominated for an Academy Award, for ""Tár."" And we held each other. We are from the same town. We held each other, and for thirty years -- we made our first movie together; I was his assistant. And we held each other, and for thirty years, it felt like there was an embrace of all the hard work that went into this, and it's just deeply moving for all of us.

Thank you, Netflix, for supporting us. Thank you to my wife and my kids. Thank you, Ted Sarandos, Sasha Bühler, Scott Stuber, and David Kosse, for making our movie. [Pointing behind him] Thank you, Malte Grunert. These two wonderful actors. My producer. Daniel Brühl and Albrecht Schuch, the actors. And especially, Felix Kammerer. This was your first movie. This was your first movie and you carried us on your shoulders as if it was nothing. Without you, none of us would be here. Thank you, Felix."
2022,Music (Original Score),Volker Bertelmann,"VOLKER BERTELMANN:
Well, thank you so much. Thanks to the Academy for this huge recognition. When I was working on the film I was thinking a couple of times of my mom, because she was telling me, every now and then, when you want to change humanity and empathy in the world you have to start by yourself and with your own surroundings. Because you learn by that. And you can show actually where we all, how we all can live together. So, you know, by working on a film like that you're always, are deeply touched, and sometimes you have to make the screen very small because there is so much explosions happening. I want to say thank you to my wife Elisabeth and my kids up there [pointing to the balcony], Lotte, Paulina, Lukas. To Malte Grunert and Edward Berger and the whole cast and crew, for their amazing craftsmanship. To Netflix, for their huge support. And to my fellow nominees, Carter, John, Justin, Son Lux, for, that I can be a part of such a unique, human and diverse group of talented composers. That's, for me, a big gift. And last but not least, I want to thank all of you for this wonderful evening. Thank you so much."
2022,Writing (Original Screenplay),Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert,"DANIEL SCHEINERT:
Oh my god! All right. Okay, I had a fantasy as a kid of winning an award and going up and telling off all the teachers that gave my brother and I detention. So here goes… I'm just kidding. These are teachers that changed my life, most of them public school teachers. Ms. Dummier, Mr. Toole, Mr. Hudson, Mr. Chambers, Madame George, Ms. NFL, Ken Cheeseman, Mirta Tocci, Joan Darling and Edith Hallman, you guys educated me, you inspired me, and you taught me to be less of a butthead. Your turn.

DANIEL KWAN:
All right, my fast spiel. I never thought of myself as a screenwriter or a storyteller. I never thought I was good enough. I have self-esteem problems. I have to thank all the people, yes, so -- thank you [pointing up]. Oh god, guys! My imposter syndrome is at an all-time high. I need to thank the people who made me the storyteller that I am, starting with my mom who protected me as a child, protected the inner storyteller. My mom is sitting here somewhere, I don't know where she is, thank you for all the sacrifices you gave me. My wife, who protects me every day from the most negative thoughts I have, especially when I'm writing. And especially, I need to thank Daniel Scheinert, who is my confidence. He is the person who told me I was a storyteller and a filmmaker before I could even say that myself, and I would not be here without him. So thank you guys, thank you so much. And to my fellow nominees! Thank you so much guys. Thank you."
