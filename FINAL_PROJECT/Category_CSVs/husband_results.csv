1959 (32nd) Academy Awards,Best Motion Picture,"Sam Zimbalist, Producer (accepted by his wife Mary Zimbalist)"," MRS. SAM ZIMBALIST:
I believe my husband would have said to you that ""Ben-Hur"" is the sum of the work and talent of many people and that he would accept this award with gratitude for all of them. For himself, I think those of you whose whole lives have been spent as my husband's was, in making films, will know in your own thoughts what this moment would have meant to him. As a symbol of Sam Zimbalist I'm very proud to thank you.

Thank you. Because of this film I think I met the most wonderful man on earth – music, love, and everything he has. [To Mrs. Rubinstein:] Thank you, madame, for him.

MRS. ARTHUR RUBINSTEIN:
Thank you. Well, I must say that I am terribly moved. I'm happy that we convinced my husband to do that picture because he really wasn't, he was shy about it. He didn't want to do it. I'm very moved because people selected, and the Academy selected it. And that everybody voted, I mean the friends voted, those who liked it. And then I'm also very moved by being in this hall where my husband usually plays. And that he should receive this award, I mean here the producer, it's very moving too. And I'm sorry he's not here.

Thank you, Chuck.  My husband knew he was to be honored tonight and he prepared his thanks.  May I read what he wrote:  ""It couldn't have come at a better time in a man's life.  Had it come earlier it would have aroused deep feelings in me; still, not so deep as now.  I am very grateful to my rich, warm, creative, talented, intimate colleagues who have been my life's associates.  How much richer can you be?""  Thank you for Eddie.

For some obscure reason I'm up here accepting an award for Peter Finch, or Finchie as everybody who knew him called him.  There is no reason for me to be here.  There's only one person who should be up here accepting this award and that's the person who Finch wanted up here accepting his award:  Mrs. Peter Finch.  Are you in the house, Eletha?  Come up and get your award.

MRS. PETER FINCH:
I want to say thanks to the members of the Academy and my husband.  I wish he was here tonight to be with us all, but since he isn't here I'll always cherish this for him.  And before he died he said to me, ""Darling, if I win I want to say thanks to my fellow actors who have given me encouragement over the years; and thanks to Paddy Chayefsky who have given him the part; and thanks to Barry who have tell us to come from Jamaica, to come and do this part.""  And he says, ""Most of all, thanks to you, darling, for sending the right vibes the right way.  And thanks, the members of the Academy Award."" Thank you all.

1976 (49th) Academy Awards,Actress in a Supporting Role,Beatrice Straight," BEATRICE STRAIGHT:
It's very heavy.  And I'm the dark horse.  And thank you so much, all of you. It's a great, great thrill for me and very unexpected.  Though I should have known that when I had someone like Paddy Chayefsky writing and saying things that we all feel but can't express, and when we have someone like Sidney Lumet who makes one want to act forever, and a producer like Howard Gottfried, then how can I miss?  But I know that my mother would be delighted.  She had great potential for an actress but didn't think she should do it, so she pushed me and was delighted.  And Michael Chekhov, the great actor and teacher who I studied with, who gave me a love and respect for the theater, which is the whole point of why we're all here.  It's a great profession and we have to keep thinking it all the time.  And we all do.  And we all love it.  And I'm so grateful for that and for a wonderful lady, age ninety-three, who lives here in Los Angeles, who's watching tonight.  One of our first women directors, who directed Paul Robeson in ""Othello"" in London:  Ellen van Volkenburg Browne.  Bright as ever.  Thank you.  And last but not least, my husband, who's put up with me for twenty-eight years.  Thank you so, so much.

1978 (51st) Academy Awards,Actress in a Leading Role,Jane Fonda," JANE FONDA:
[Speaking simultaniously in sign language:]  I'm so happy.  I wanted to win very much because I'm so proud of ""Coming Home,"" and I want many people to see the movie.  I'm signing part of what I'm saying tonight because, while we were making the movie, we all became more aware of the problems of the handicapped. Over 14 million people are deaf.  They are the invisible handicapped and can't share this evening, so this is my way of acknowledging them.  [End sign language.]

I'm so proud and grateful.  It's been almost eight years.  This film, ""Coming Home,"" was born in Santa Monica where we live, in the cramped offices of the Indochina Peace Campaign, as a lot of us whose lives have been bound up with the war sat on the floor.  And some of them were veterans.  I thank, I thank all of them.  One of them was my husband, Tom Hayden; one of them was Bruce Gilbert, who has become my partner and is the associate producer of ""Coming Home.""

I want to thank Waldo Salt, the first – how do you...?  Heavy.  The first industry heavy who stuck his neck out and believed in the project.  In fact he believed so much in it that he worked for two years for nothing.  And he lead us to Jerry Hellman, our producer, who fought for us.  And I want to thank you, Jerry, very much.  And I want to thank Haskell Wexler who photographed it so sensitively and Bob Jones who came through in the pinch.  And I want to thank Hal Ashby; you're not here, Hal, but I want to thank you for your taste and for your courage, for your ability with the scissors.  And I want to thank Penny Milford and Bobby Carradine and Bruce Dern and my pal Jon Voight, and Mike Medavoy and Eric Pleskow and Arthur Krim and Marcia Nasatir for getting us the money to make it.

And finally I want to thank my children, Troy and Vanessa, for being understanding and forgiving me my absences.  And again my husband, who helped me believe that besides being entertaining movies can inspire and teach and even be healing.  Thank you, all of you.  Thank the Academy very much.

And before I give the microphone to my colleagues, I would like to say that we do thank our assistant editors and apprentice editors for their marvelous, dedicated support all through the project, who kept their sense of humor and carried us through to the end.

LISA FRUCHTMAN:
""The Right Stuff"" required a monumental effort on the part of a lot of people, not all of whom we can thank tonight, but I'd like to just add to those already mentioned our producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler, who were the first to see the possibilities for a terrific movie in Tom Wolfe's book.  And again, our director Phil Kaufman, who transformed that book into a fantastic script and then into a fantastic movie from which we were able to work with terrific footage and whose vision carried us throughout the editing. For myself, I'd like to just thank my husband for his unwavering support during a difficult year and a half, and my colleagues Francis Coppola, Walter Murch and Bill Reynolds, without whose support and inspiration I wouldn't be here tonight.  Thank you.

STEPHEN A. ROTTER:
If I can just thank my wife Janet, my daughter Zoe, my good friend Dede Allen, and Phil and Rose.  Thank you very much.

DOUGLAS STEWART:

Thank you very much, Gregory.  And every friend and every colleague, your generosity fills me with happiness and great pride.  I remember my first Oscar.  It was so overwhelming for me that the terror of having to face you all made me find so many excuses not to be with you thirty, thirty years ago. Tonight I'm still scared, but I'm not alone.  And I will share this eventful evening with the three men in my life.  My husband Carlo Ponti, without whom I wouldn't be the person I am today.  And my two sons, Carlo, Jr. and Edoardo, that taught me to conjugate the verb ""to love.""  Now a thousand feelings crowd my heart while I'm holding this wonderful statue and words are very difficult to find for me and to express it all in this wonderful moment in my life, so I'll try to revert in my native language and say simply: Grazie, America. Thank you.

Ridley, I couldn't thank you in forty-five years much less forty-five seconds so I won't try now.  Geena and Susan, I think you've made the world a better place for those performances.  I love you.  I want to thank my husband who helped me so much in ways that I could never tell him, and it wasn't by being like ""Darryl.""  He wasn't the model for any of the characters. In fact my brother was.  I'm just kidding.  I really want to thank my mother who taught me everything about love and loyalty that a gal could ever need to know.  And all my friends and family, thank you.  Thanks.

Well, when I was a student, which doesn't feel like so very long ago, I used to feel deeply cynical about awards nights like this, but tonight I'm really overwhelmed.

And I'd like to say a very big thank you to my actors: Holly; Anna; Harvey and Sam who aren't here but were such gorgeous, tender, and vulnerable men in ""The Piano.""

I'd like to say thank you to the Academy for this honor.  And it's just so wonderful to be acknowledged with a great group of movies.  Nine years ago I met a very special man who has since taken me on an amazing journey.  There were many people who gave him gifts along the way.  Eric Roth, you gave ""Forrest"" a soul.  Tom Hanks, you gave ""Forrest"" a heart.  And Bob Zemeckis, you gave ""Forrest"" a vision.  Steve Tisch and Steve Starkey, you were great co-parents.  ""Forrest"" was a labor of love to many people:  our wonderful cast and crew, Sherry, Jon, Michelle, John, Barry, Arthur, all the people at Paramount, Winston, Craig, Rand.  To my parents, grandparents, family, thank you for your support.  To my husband Mark Canton, for your love and always saying go make this dream a reality.  My parents always said dreams can come true, and to my own children, Dorothy, Henry and James, if you doubt it, please remember tonight because I always will.  Thank you.

STEVE TISCH:
All over the political map people have been calling ""Forrest"" their own.  But ""Forrest Gump"" isn't about politics or conservative values.  It's about humanity.  It's about respect, tolerance and unconditional love.  And tonight we should all feel proud that we are in a business where we entertain, we educate, and we empower.  I'd like to thank my family, my parents Joan and Bob, love to Jamie and to my two wonderful children, Hilary and Willy, and to my four best friends.  And finally, thanks to all the ""Forrest Gumps"" in the world.

STEVE STARKEY:
Well, I truly want to thank the Academy for making me the final person to thank them tonight.  Now I don't know if it was destiny or if it was chance that brought together the talented cast and extraordinary crew of ""Forrest Gump,"" but maybe as ""Forrest"" said: ""Maybe it was both, maybe both were happening at the same time.""  But in any case, as I look back I can't imagine making this film without any one of them or without the commitment of Sherry Lansing and Paramount Studios.  But most of all, the picture could not have been made without the gentle spirit of Tom Hanks and the guidance and inspiration of the guy we fondly call Bob Z, the truly visionary director Bob Zemeckis.  And I wish to thank them all, and especially my wife Olivia who has stood beside me over the years in everything I've done.  And hello to my parents.  Thank you all very much.

Well, ""Trevor"" first came to life as a stage piece conceived after our wonderful writer James Lecesne heard a report on NPR about teen suicide and learned that approximately one-third of all teens who kill themselves are gay. We made our film for anyone who's ever felt like an outsider.  It celebrates all those who make it through difficult times and mourns those who didn't.  In honoring us the Academy honors everyone who so generously supported our project.  Our thanks to them and my husband Josh who helps make all things possible.

RANDY STONE:
This project was a perfect experience for us.  From the beginning it seemed to be blessed.  Everybody we asked to help said yes.  Peggy, James and myself wanted to send a message.

2001 (74th) Academy Awards,Short Film (Live Action),"Ray McKinnon, Lisa Blount (accompanied on stage by producer Walton Goggins)"," RAY McKINNON:
I thought we were going to get a little short one.  We'd like to thank the Academy for this wonderful honor in a category that still allows for a person who is just burning to make a movie to load the camera in the back of his daddy's old truck, gather up some talented dreamers and do it.  And if the stars align and the fates conspire that person might find themselves standing right here at the good God Almighty Academy Awards.  I want to thank everybody who helped us on our film, especially my two partners here, my true friend Walton Goggins and my dear and beautiful wife Lisa Blount.

LISA BLOUNT:
As one door was seemingly closing in my life, another door opened.  And I only have one person to thank for that, my husband Ray McKinnon.

WALTON GOGGINS:
I just get to thank our momma and daddies and Eddie King, Blake Jackson.  And Red, we might be able to pay you back.  Thank you.

2004 (77th) Academy Awards,Actress in a Leading Role,Hilary Swank," HILARY SWANK:
I don't know what I did in this life to deserve all this. I'm just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream. I never thought this would ever happen, let alone be nominated. And a working actor, for that matter. And now, this. I thank the Academy. I am eternally grateful for this great honor. I would also like to acknowledge my fellow nominees. Annette, Imelda, Kate and Catalina, your work inspires me beyond words.

I am going to start by thanking my husband because I'd like to think I learn from past mistakes. Chad, you're my everything. Thank you for your support. It means the world. I would never be standing here if it weren't for each and every one of the brilliant people I had surrounding me, supporting me and believing in me. Tom Rosenberg, Gary Lucchesi, thank you for sending me this most marvelous script. You will never know how grateful I am. Paul Haggis, for writing this beautiful script. Our other producers extraordinaire: Al Ruddy, Clint, Rob Lorenz. Phyllis Huffman, our casting director. My trainers, Grant Roberts and Héctor Roca, you pushed me further than I ever thought I could push myself, up to that last pound, actually to that last ounce. I thank you. My sparring partners who were so patient. And everyone at Gleason's. Well, the ever-amazing Morgan Freeman. Tom Stern, our cinematographer, you are brilliant. Joel Cox, our editor, you're amazing. You know? I'm going to thank my mom for believing in me from the beginning; my dad for his support. My agents: Josh Lieberman, Tony Lipp, Kelly Tiffan, John Campisi. Jason Weinberg, my manager. [Music begins to play.]  Uh uh, you can't do that, because I haven't gotten to Clint yet. I saved him for the end. Karl Austen, Jeff Bernstein, my lawyers.

And then... Clint. Clint Eastwood, thank you for allowing me to go on this journey with you. Thank you for believing in me. You're my ""Mo Cuishle."" Thank you.

Alan Horn and Warner Bros., as well, thank you. [Music starts up again.] And you know what? Wait! Troy Nankin!  Troy Nankin, my best friend and publicist! Thank you!

Thank you very much. Thank you to the Academy who know Katharine Hepburn so well and is so intimately acquainted with her work. This is an indescribable surprise and honor. Thank you.

I know you think it's cheesy, sweetheart, but I have to thank you, my husband.  And Hylda Queally and Robyn Gardiner, my uber-agents. And the wonderful Lisa Kasteler. Everyone involved in ""The Aviator."" When you play someone as terrifyingly well-known as Katharine Hepburn, it's a collaborative effort; you need as much help as you can get. And thank you, of course, to Miss Hepburn. The longevity of her career, I think, is inspiring to everyone. But most importantly, and on behalf of everyone I know in ""The Aviator,"" thank you to Martin Scorsese. I hope my son will marry your daughter. Thank you.

Thank you also to our financiers:  Andy Reimer, Jan Körbelin, Marina Grasic, Bob Yari. To our producers, our partners:  Mark Harris and Bob Yari and Don Cheadle and Bobby Moresco, thank you.

Well, I'm very happy to be here but it's also very frightening to be here. So in one way I wanted to get this doll [pats the Oscar], and another, I was frightened. But thank you very, very much.

I want to thank Francis, first of all, for introducing me to Sofia when we were doing ""Cotton Club."" And she was this [motions to her height as a girl], and now she's my director. I think she did a wonderful movie; her movie is like a poem and she inspired me. I haven't prepared this speech so I have to hurry up because Marshall, my husband, said I have to get out of here quickly. So I want to thank everybody who had anything to do with this movie. Without them I wouldn't be here, and it's a communal effort, therefore thank everybody very, very much. I want to dedicate this award first of all to Momma, then Hugh Hudson, and Stanley Kubrick, my great master. Without them, I wouldn't be here.  Thank you.
"
2006 (79th) Academy Awards,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,Sherry Lansing," SHERRY LANSING:
I am deeply honored and very grateful to receive this award, but I also must admit that it feels a little strange to be singled out; so many of you have causes that you are equally passionate about. That is really what is so wonderful about the movie industry, not only do we get to make films that matter, but we also work in a culture where we are encouraged to speak out. We may not always agree, but we do always care.

Through my work I have met scientists who struggle every day to find cures for diseases.  They do so quietly, without glamour or attention, but always with passion and conviction. I have met school teachers who are battling against insurmountable odds, and yet they never stop trying to reach our children. To me they are the real heroes, and tonight I share this honor with all of them.

On a personal note, I want to thank my husband Billy and our two boys, Cedric and Jack, whose unconditional love gives me the courage to fight every day for what I believe in. And a special thank you to the members of the Academy for this extraordinary honor. I promise to spend the rest of my life trying to live up to it.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.

It was Lieutenant Laurel Hester's dying wish that her fight against discrimination would make a difference for all the same-sex couples across the country that face discrimination every day, discrimination that I don't face as a married woman.  I want to thank Sheila Nevins and HBO for making this film have a broadcast and a home on Cinemax later this year.  To my husband Matthew Syrett, who took care of our children and held down a full-time job so that we could make this film.  And to our incredible team in New York, thank you so much.

VANESSA ROTH:
And to all our supporters and our families who believed even a thirty-eight minute movie could change minds and lives, and our children who remind us about what's really important.  And to Stacie, who's here tonight, who's really auto mechanic by day but hero in life who always did what was right. And she's here tonight.  So thank you so much.  Thank you.

CYNTHIA WADE:
Thank you, Stacie.  Thank you.

It came true. Thank you so much to the Academy for this and for nominating me with Helen Hunt, Jacki Weaver, Amy Adams and Sally Field. I look up to you all so much and it's just been such an honor. Thank you.

There are so many people whose generosity and support is the reason that I'm standing here right now. I must thank Hugh Jackman. Hugh, you're the best. The cast, the crew, especially Simon Hayes and the sound wizards. Congratulations on tonight, you guys. The creative team behind ""Les Misérables"": Cameron Mackintosh, Tom Hooper; from Working Title: Eric Fellner, Tim Bevan, Debra Hayward; and from Universal: Ron Meyer, Donna Langley and Adam Fogelson. Thank you, guys, for your faith and thank you for this opportunity.

I have to thank my team, led by the lionhearted Suzan Bymel. Josh Lieberman, Mick Sullivan, Maha Dakhil… Please say I just said everyone. Josh Lieberman again, just to be safe. Stephen Huvane, Jason Sloane and special contributions by Frank Selvaggi and Kerry Wagner. I want to thank my friends, especially the ones who are cheering from Crosby Street tonight. My family, who I'm so blessed to be a part of. My husband. By far and away, the greatest moment of my life is the one when you walked into it. I love you so much.

And thank you for this. Here's hoping that someday in the not too distant future the misfortunes of ""Fantine"" will only be found in stories and nevermore in real life. Thank you.

I just happened to be wearing the kilt; I didn't plan any of this. I'd like to thank the Academy for this incredible honor. Making a movie has its own story. I'd like to thank John Lasseter, Ed Catmull, Jim Morris, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, Brenda Chapman, Katherine Sarafian for making the making of ""Brave"" an exceptional story. My wife and my four kids: Maeve, Jack, Paden and Ford.

BRENDA CHAPMAN:

2013 (86th) Academy Awards,Actress in a Leading Role,Cate Blanchett," CATE BLANCHETT:
Sit down; you're too old to be standing. Thank you, Mr. Day-Lewis. From you it exacerbates this honor to it and it blows it right out of the ballpark. Thank you so much to the Academy. As random and as subjective as this award is, it means a great deal in a year of extraordinary – yet again – extraordinary performances by women. Amy Adams, everything you do, but your performance in ""American Hustle"" blew my mind. And Meryl, what can I say? Sandra, I could watch that performance to the end of time, and I sort of felt like I had. Julia, #suckit. You know what I mean? And Judi Dench, I mean what a career. She's not here tonight because at the age of 79 her film was so successful that she's in India doing a sequel. I mean what a career that is, if I could hope.

And me, I'm here accepting an award in an extraordinary screenplay by Woody Allen. Thank you so much, Woody, for casting me. I truly appreciate it. I'm so very proud that ""Blue Jasmine"" stayed in the cinemas for as long as it did. And thank you to Sony Classics, to Michael and Tom, for their extraordinary support, for so bravely and intelligently distributing the film. And to the audiences who went to see it, and perhaps those of us in the industry who are still foolishly clinging to the idea that female films with women at the center are niche experiences. They are not. Audiences want to see them and, in fact, they earn money. So... The world is round, people!

Thank you to my mum, to my sister, to my brother, to my three glorious sons; I would not be standing here without you. To my husband Andrew, you are a legend. Thank you to my agent Hylda Queally; you're behind the pillar somewhere up there. You are a goddess. To my agent in Australia, Robyn Gardiner, I love you so very much. To my publicist Lisa Kasteler. To the sublime Sally Hawkins and to the extraordinary cast of ""Blue Jasmine,"" I don't know how to do this without other actors and this I share with you. To the hair and makeup people who sweated me up and tried to make me look attractive, thank you for the attempt. To Carla Meyer, for getting Sally and I together and for incredible support. To Helen Robin. To everyone involved in ""Blue Jasmine,"" I thank you so much.

And finally, I would like to thank every single member of the Sydney Theatre Company, one of the great theater companies in the world. For me working on ""Blue Jasmine,"" it was a real synthesis of my work in the theater and on film. And not only working with you for the last six years has been the most enormous privilege of my career, but it's made me a better actress. There is so much talent in Australia, and Michael Wilkinson and CM and I are just tonight's tip of the iceberg. Thank you so much. Thank you.

2014 (87th) Academy Awards,Actress in a Leading Role,Julianne Moore," JULIANNE MOORE:
Thank you so much. I read an article that said that winning an Oscar could lead to living five years longer. If that's true, I'd really like to thank the Academy because my husband is younger than me. There's no such thing as best actress, as is evidenced by the performances of my fellow nominees. I've been honored to be among you every step of the way. I am grateful for this and grateful for the opportunity to stand up here and thank people that I love. My manager Evelyn O'Neill, Kevin Huvane, Steven Huvane, Josh Lieberman. My family: my grandparents, my brother Peter, my sister Valerie, my mother and father who told me that I could be whatever I wanted to be if I got an education. Although I didn't think they meant being an actress. And I thank my dad for showing me the world.

I want to thank everybody who made this movie: Sony Classics, Killer Films, James Brown, Lex Lutzus, Lisa Genova, Kristen Stewart, Alec Baldwin. I'm so happy, I'm thrilled, actually, that we were able to hopefully shine a light on Alzheimer's disease. So many people with this disease feel isolated and marginalized, and one of the wonderful things about movies is it makes us feel seen and not alone. And people with Alzheimer's deserve to be seen, so that we can find a cure. And finally, to our filmmakers, Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, who had hoped to be here tonight but they can't because of Richard's health. When Richard was diagnosed with ALS, Wash asked him what he wanted to do. Did he want to travel? Did he want to see the world? And he said that he wanted to make movies, and that's what he did. And finally, for my husband Bart and our children, Cal and Liv, thank you for my life, thank you for giving me a home. Thank you very much for this.

From Saba, the woman in my film who remarkably survived an honor killing and shared her story, to Sheila Nevins and Lisa Heller from HBO, to Tina Brown, who supported me from day one. To the men who champion women, like Geof Bartz in my film, who's edited the film, to Asad Faruqi, to my friend Ziad, who brought this film to the government. To all the brave men out there, like my father and my husband, who push women to go to school and work and who want a more just society for women.

Thank you to the Academy. You know, there's one place that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered. One place. And that's the graveyard. People ask me all the time, ""What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?"" And I say, exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories. The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition. People who fell in love and lost. I became an artist, and thank god I did, because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life. So here's to August Wilson, who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.

And to Bron Pictures, Paramount, MACRO, Todd Black, Molly Allen, Scott Rudin for being the cheerleaders for a movie that is about people, and words, and life, and forgiveness and grace. And to Mykelti Williamson, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Russell Hornsby, Jovan Adepo, Saniyya Sidney, for being the most wonderful artists I've ever worked with. And, ""O captain, my captain,"" Denzel Washington. Thank you for puttin' two entities in the driving seat: August and God. And they served you well.

And to Dan and Mae Alice Davis, who were the, and are the center of my universe. The people who taught me, good or bad, how to fail, how to love, how to hold an award, how to lose. My parents. I'm so thankful that God chose you to bring me into this world. To my sisters. My sister Deloris, who's here, who played Jaji and Jaja with me. We were rich white women in the tea party games.
