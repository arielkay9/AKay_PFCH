1968 (41st) Academy Awards,Actress,Barbra Streisand," BARBRA STREISAND:
[To the Oscar:]  Hello, gorgeous.

And I'm very honored to be in such magnificent company as Katharine Hepburn. And gee whiz, it's kind of a wild feeling. Sitting there tonight I was thinking that the first script of ""Funny Girl"" was written when I was only eleven years old, and thank God it took so long to get it right, you know. So I would like to thank my co-producer Ray Stark for waiting till I grew up. And Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, for giving me such a great score to sing. And Isobel Lennart, for writing such a terrific character. And all the Hollywood people who made our show into a movie: Herb Ross, and my dear Harry Stradling who I haven't let go since, and my dear friend and director, William Wyler. Wow. It's like, somebody once said to me, asked me, if I was happy. And I said, ""Are you kidding? I'd be miserable if I was happy."" And I'd like to thank all the members of the Academy for making me really miserable. Thank you.

1974 (47th) Academy Awards,Honorary Award,To Howard Hawks - A master American filmmaker whose creative efforts hold a distinguished place in world cinema.," HOWARD HAWKS:
Thank you, Duke.  I'm going to tell you a little story.  Jack Ford and I were friends.  He was a better friend to Duke...

JOHN WAYNE:
Thank God.

HOWARD HAWKS:
And when he became sick and came to the desert to die, I used to go over and see him.  We'd talk and laugh.  Then we got to telling each other the things that we'd stolen from each other.  And we often tried to remember all of the things I tried to, that I took from Ford and he did from me.  One day he was laughing and he said, ""There's something I took from you that beats the whole thing.""  He said, ""I made a picture that wasn't so good, and you made 'Sergeant York.'""  And he said, ""I got the award.""  And he stopped in the middle of laughing and he changed – just as Duke knows and other people, he changed quickly.  And he said, ""Well, you're gonna get an award.""  And I said, ""I don't think so.""  He said, ""Goddamn it!  You're gonna get an award.""  So I would like to thank the Academy for making that prediction of his come true. Thanks very much.

1976 (49th) Academy Awards,Short Film (Live Action),"Andre Guttfreund and Peter Werner, Producers"," ANDRE GUTTFREUND:
Since the nominations themselves were not announced I would like, out of respect for those people who were nominated with us, to announce them as well. That's ""Kudzu,"" Marjorie Anne Short, producer; ""Morning Spider,"" Julian Chagrin and Claude Chagrin, producers; ""Nightlife,"" Claire Wilbur and Robin Lehman, producers; and ""Number One,"" Dyan Cannon and Vince Cannon, producers.

On the one hand trembling and speechless, on the other hand with some very important thanks to give.  To the American Film Institute, for most of the financing and two fruitful years at the center.  To Joyce Carol Oates, for her beautiful story and her great kindness.  To Fionnuala Flanagan, Peter Lempert and the rest of the cast and crew, who were as giving as they were talented in their work.  To Heinz and Gush Guttfreund, for their patience and generosity. To all of those who have wished us well throughout and are at home rejoicing. And to you, for honoring all of those who made ""In the Region of Ice"" and for making me feel this privileged.  Thank you very much.

PETER WERNER:
We had an incredible crew, and I think one of the most important lessons I learned is that to do something excellently doesn't have to be a painful and terrible experience.  I'd also like to thank my friends, from here to Vermont, who have given me tremendous love, and also criticism, when I needed it.  And above all, I thank God for this whole process.  Thank you.

1981 (54th) Academy Awards,Directing,Warren Beatty," WARREN BEATTY:
Thank you.  Miss Keaton, I know that public expressions like this can be embarrassing sometimes and that my chances of speaking with you privately later are at the moment excellent.  I do want to tell you that you make every director that you work with look good, and I think that what they're trying to tell me here tonight, thank God, is that I'm no exception.  Mr. Nicholson, I know that you're enjoying my being up here almost as much as I am in being here.

I know I do one thing well, I get good people:  Elaine May, Peter Feibleman, Jeremy Pikser, Robert Towne, Simon Relph, Zelda Barron, Richie Cirincione, Steve Sondheim, Dave Grusin, David MacLeod, so many, many more among whom are the people that you've nominated here tonight and happily saved me from having to remember to name fourteen more names.  I do want to name Mr. Barry Diller who runs Paramount, Mr. Dick Zimbert who's been very kind to me, Mr. Frank Mancuso, and Mr. Charles Bluhdorn who runs Gulf + Western and God knows what else.  And I want to say to you gentlemen that no matter how much we might have liked to have strangled each other from time to time, I think that your decision, taken in the great capitalistic tower of Gulf + Western, to finance a three-and-a-half hour romance which attempts to reveal for the first time just something of the beginnings of American socialism and American communism, reflects credit not only upon you, I think it reflects credit upon Hollywood and the movie business wherever that is.  And I think that it reflects more particular credit on the freedom of expression that we have in our American society and the lack of censorship that we have from the government or the people who put up the money.  Thanks.

Then to Jeffrey Katzenberg, who kept his cool under tremendous duress, and thank God or I wouldn't be here tonight.

And so Bob should have...Anyway, there's an awful lot of Bob in these [holding up his two Oscars].  And we had some marvelous animators on the film, and I have to single out one who I used as pillars.  He held up bits of that film like a bunch of pillars.  And that is Andreas Deja.  Thank you.

All those mothers and fathers without whose strong performances the film would not have been as balanced and had as much dignity as it did, I thank you for that.  Big thanks to Sean Penn for your intelligence and your courage and your humor, and your hair-do.  It was a great dance.  Thank you so much.

To my kids, Eva, Jack Henry, and Miles.  Thanks for being such good sports, and who were in the movie and did a great job.  And finally, to my partner in crime and in all things of the heart, the writer, the producer, the director, the spirit, Tim Robbins.  You kept us on track, you fought so hard.

1997 (70th) Academy Awards,Actress in a Leading Role,Helen Hunt," HELEN HUNT:
The first time I saw ""Mrs. Brown"" -- saw it three times.  The first time I saw it, I leaned over to my beloved and said, ""She's [Judi Dench] going to win an Academy Award.""  And in my mind tonight she has.  And so has Julie Christie, and so has Helena Bonham Carter, and so has Kate Winslet.  And for that matter so has Billy Connolly, and so has Ben Affleck, and so has Joan Allen.  And I am honored to work in a year when there were so many magnificent performances.

I am here for one reason and that's Jim Brooks.  One single reason, and that's the only reason really.  That's the only reason.  I thank -- I am tired of thanking you -- I thank God for giving me a little piece of you.  Jack, I worship you, you know it.  Greg, I hope you hold in your heart how beautiful your performance in this movie was.  I would like to thank our producers Bridget Johnson, Kristi Zea, Larry Mark.  Everyone at Sony.  The team of experts it took to make me available for this movie.  My acting teachers Lurene Tuttle, wherever you are, Gordon Hunt, Larry Moss, Gary Austin, for giving me a way to learn about myself and the world, and a way to express myself.  I hate to think who I would be without that.  My parents, who are sobbing at this point.  My friends, who are at home jumping up and down.  And you [Hank Azaria], the very, just the very best man I know.  Thank you so much.  This is a magnificent honor.  Thank you very much.

Oh my God. I have to just take this moment in. I cannot believe this. Look what God can do. If my grandmother--I didn't think I was going to win but, wow, if my grandmother was here to see me now. She was my biggest inspiration for everything because she was a singer, and she had the passion for it but she never had the chance, and that was the thing that pushed me forward to continue. But I'm so grateful to have my mother here celebrating with me. My boyfriend, my sisters and my brothers back home, and then I've got two of them here, thank you all for being here and supporting me. Also I'd like to thank Bill Condon, our director, who's a genius. Wow. Oh my God. Unbelievable cast. I'd like to thank the Academy. Definitely have to thank God, I guess, again. I can't believe this. Wow, I don't know what to say but I thank you all for helping me keep the faith even when I didn't believe. Thank you and God bless you all. [Music begins] Jennifer Holliday, too!

2010 (83rd) Academy Awards,Directing,Tom Hooper," TOM HOOPER:
Wow.  Thank you to all the members of the Academy.  This is an extraordinary honor.  I'd like to congratulate my fellow nominees:  Darren, David, David, Joel and Ethan.  Your work this year has been extraordinary and I'm honored to be nominated alongside you.  Thank you to my wonderful actors.  The triangle of man love, which is Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and me.  I'm only here because of you guys, and Helena, I hope that reference doesn't make you too jealous.  Thank you to all my cast; to my wonderful crew; to my producers, Iain, Gareth, Emile; to David Seidler, whose extraordinary journey from childhood stammerer to the stage of the Kodak I find so profoundly moving.

But most of all, thank you to my parents, my mum and dad who are in the audience tonight.  And I know there's been a lot of thanking of mums, but this is slightly different because my mum in 2007 was invited by some Australian friends—she's Australian—in London to a fringe theater play reading of an unproduced, unrehearsed play called ""The King's Speech.""  Now she's never been invited to a play reading in her entire life before.  She almost didn't go because it didn't sound exactly promising, but thank god she did because she came home, rang me up and said, ""Tom, I think I found your next film.""  So with this [holding up the Oscar] tonight, I honor you.  And the moral of the story is:  Listen to your mother.
"
2013 (86th) Academy Awards,Actor in a Leading Role,Matthew McConaughey," MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY:
Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to the Academy for this, all six thousand members. Thank you to the other nominees. All these performances were impeccable in my opinion; I didn't see a false note anywhere. I want to thank Jean-Marc Vallée, our director. I want to thank Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner, who I worked with daily.

There's a few things, about three things, to my account that I need each day. One of 'em is something to look up to. Another is something to look forward to. And another is someone to chase. Now, first off, I want to thank God, 'cause that's who I look up to. He has graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand. He has shown me that it's a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. In the words of the late Charlie Laughton*, who said, ""When you've got God, you've got a friend. And that friend is you.""

To my family, that's who and what I look forward to. To my father, who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo. He's got a lemon meringue pie over there. He's probably in his underwear and he's got a cold can of Miller Lite. And he's dancin' right now. To you, Dad, you taught me what it means to be a man. To my mother who's here tonight, who taught me and my two older brothers – demanded – that we respect ourselves, and what we in turn learned was then we were better able to respect others. Thank you for that, Mama. To my wife Camila and my kids, Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone, the courage and significance you give me every day I go out the door is unparalleled. You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me. Thank you.

And to my hero; that's who I chase. Now, when I was 15 years old I had a very important person in my life come to me and say, ""Who's your hero?"" And I said, I don't know; I gotta think about that. Give me a couple of weeks. I come back two weeks later, this person comes up and says, ""Who's your hero?"" I said, I thought about it. You know who it is? I said, it's me in 10 years. So I turned 25; ten years later that same person comes to me and goes, ""So, are you a hero?"" And I was like, not even close! No, no, no. She said, ""Why?"" I said, because my hero's me at 35. So you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero's always 10 years away. I'm never gonna be my hero. I'm not gonna attain that; I know I'm not. And that's just fine with me, because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasin'.

So to any of us, whatever those things are: whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we're chasin'. To that I say: Amen. To that I say: Alright, alright, alright. To that I say: Just keep livin'. Thank you.

2014 (87th) Academy Awards,Music (Original Song),Music and Lyric by John Stephens and Lonnie Lynn," LONNIE LYNN (Common):
First, I would like to thank God that lives in us all. Recently John and I got to go to Selma and perform ""Glory"" on the same bridge that Dr. King and the people of the civil rights movement marched on fifty years ago. This bridge was once a landmark of a divided nation but now is a symbol for change. The spirit of this bridge transcends race, gender, religion, sexual orientation and social status. The spirit of this bridge connects the kid from the South Side of Chicago dreaming of a better life, to those in France standing up for their freedom of expression, to the people in Hong Kong protesting for democracy. This bridge was built on hope, welded with compassion and elevated by love for all human beings.

JOHN STEPHENS (John Legend):
Thank you. Nina Simone said it's an artist's duty to reflect the times in which we live. We wrote this song for a film that was based on events that were fifty years ago, but we say that Selma is now because the struggle for justice is right now. We know that the Voting Rights Act that they fought for fifty years ago is being compromised right now in this country today. We know that right now the struggle for freedom and justice is real. We live in the most incarcerated country in the world. There are more black men under correctional control today than were under slavery in 1850. When people are marching with our song, we want to tell you we are with you, we see you, we love you, and march on. God bless you.

LONNIE LYNN (Common):
Thank you, Ava. Thank you, Ava. Thank you, thank you, Ava, Oprah, and Harpo and Plan B.

People ask me all the time, ""What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?"" And I say, exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories. The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition. People who fell in love and lost.

And to Mykelti Williamson, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Russell Hornsby, Jovan Adepo, Saniyya Sidney, for being the most wonderful artists I've ever worked with. And, ""O captain, my captain,"" Denzel Washington. Thank you for puttin' two entities in the driving seat: August and God. And they served you well.

And all you people out there who feel like there's no mirror for you, that your life is not reflected – the Academy has your back. The ACLU has your back. We have your back.

Amen, brother. I just want to echo everything you just said and all those thanks.
