And gee whiz, it\'s kind of a wild feeling. Sitting there tonight I was thinking that the first script of ""Funny Girl"" was written when I was only eleven years old, and thank God it took so long to get it right, you know. So I would like to thank my co-producer Ray Stark for waiting till I grew up. And Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, for giving me such a great score to sing. And Isobel Lennart, for writing such a terrific character. And all the Hollywood people who made our show into a movie: Herb Ross, and my dear Harry Stradling who I haven\'t let go since, and my dear friend and director, William Wyler. Wow. It\'s like, somebody once said to me, asked me, if I was happy. And I said, ""Are you kidding? I\'d be miserable if I was happy."" And I\'d like to thank all the members of the Academy for making me really miserable. Thank you.\n'}","{'Year': '1968', 'Winner': 'Barbra Streisand', 'Film': '', 'Won': '', 'Notes': ''}"

Big thanks to Martha Luttrell and Nancy Seltzer for their support.\n\nTo the crew who worked so hard and so well for so little to keep me safe and make me laugh and do their job, I thank you.  The crew, the rest of the ensemble, especially Celia, Ray Barry, R. Lee Ermey, Roberta Maxwell, Lois Smith.  All those mothers and fathers without whose strong performances the film would not have been as balanced and had as much dignity as it did, I thank you for that.

Thanks for being such good sports, and who were in the movie and did a great job.  And finally, to my partner in crime and in all things of the heart, the writer, the producer, the director, the spirit, Tim Robbins.  You kept us on track, you fought so hard.  Thank God for your stubbornness.  Thank God for everything about you.  We would not have anything without you.  This is yours as much as mine.  Thank God we live together.  May all of us find in our hearts and in our homes and in our world a way to nonviolently end violence and heal.

"{'Year': '1997 (70th) Academy Awards', 'Category': 'Actress in a Leading Role', 'Winner': 'Helen Hunt', 'Speech': ' HELEN HUNT:\nThe first time I saw ""Mrs. Brown"" -- saw it three times.  The first time I saw it, I leaned over to my beloved and said, ""She\'s [Judi Dench] going to win an Academy Award.""  And in my mind tonight she has.  And so has Julie Christie, and so has Helena Bonham Carter, and so has Kate Winslet.  And for that matter so has Billy Connolly, and so has Ben Affleck, and so has Joan Allen.  And I am honored to work in a year when there were so many magnificent performances.\n\nI am here for one reason and that\'s Jim Brooks.  One single reason, and that\'s the only reason really.  That\'s the only reason.  I thank -- I am tired of thanking you -- I thank God for giving me a little piece of you.  Jack, I worship you, you know it.  Greg, I hope you hold in your heart how beautiful your performance in this movie was.  I would like to thank our producers Bridget Johnson, Kristi Zea, Larry Mark.  Everyone at Sony.  The team of experts it took to make me available for this movie.  My acting teachers Lurene Tuttle, wherever you are, Gordon Hunt, Larry Moss, Gary Austin, for giving me a way to learn about myself and the world, and a way to express myself.  I hate to think who I would be without that.  My parents, who are sobbing at this point.  My friends, who are at home jumping up and down.  And you [Hank Azaria], the very, just the very best man I know.  Thank you so much.  This is a magnificent honor.  Thank you very much.\n'}","{'Year': '1997', 'Winner': 'Helen Hunt', 'Film': '', 'Won': '', 'Notes': ''}"

I cannot believe this. Look what God can do. If my grandmother--I didn't think I was going to win but, wow, if my grandmother was here to see me now. She was my biggest inspiration for everything because she was a singer, and she had the passion for it but she never had the chance, and that was the thing that pushed me forward to continue. But I'm so grateful to have my mother here celebrating with me. My boyfriend, my sisters and my brothers back home, and then I've got two of them here, thank you all for being here and supporting me. Also I'd like to thank Bill Condon, our director, who's a genius. Wow. Oh my God. Unbelievable cast. I'd like to thank the Academy. Definitely have to thank God, I guess, again. I can't believe this. Wow, I don't know what to say but I thank you all for helping me keep the faith even when I didn't believe. Thank you and God bless you all.

"{'Year': '2016 (89th) Academy Awards', 'Category': 'Actress in a Supporting Role', 'Winner': 'Viola Davis', 'Speech': ' VIOLA DAVIS:\nThank you to the Academy. You know, there\'s one place that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered. One place. And that\'s the graveyard. People ask me all the time, ""What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?"" And I say, exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories. The stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dreams to fruition. People who fell in love and lost. I became an artist, and thank god I did, because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life. So here\'s to August Wilson, who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.\n\nAnd to Bron Pictures, Paramount, MACRO, Todd Black, Molly Allen, Scott Rudin for being the cheerleaders for a movie that is about people, and words, and life, and forgiveness and grace. And to Mykelti Williamson, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Russell Hornsby, Jovan Adepo, Saniyya Sidney, for being the most wonderful artists I\'ve ever worked with. And, ""O captain, my captain,"" Denzel Washington. Thank you for puttin\' two entities in the driving seat: August and God. And they served you well.\n\nAnd to Dan and Mae Alice Davis, who were the, and are the center of my universe. The people who taught me, good or bad, how to fail, how to love, how to hold an award, how to lose. My parents. I\'m so thankful that God chose you to bring me into this world. To my sisters. My sister Deloris, who\'s here, who played Jaji and Jaja with me. We were rich white women in the tea party games. Thank you for the imagination. And to my husband and my daughter, my heart, you and Genesis. You teach me every day how to live, how to love. I\'m so glad that you are the foundation of my life. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you.\n'}","{'Year': '2016', 'Winner': 'Viola Davis', 'Film': '', 'Won': '', 'Notes': ''}"
